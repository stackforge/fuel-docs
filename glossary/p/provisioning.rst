Provisioning
------------

The process of setting up a node into a minimal viable state with a
pre-installed operating system and required supporting components.
This process includes partitioning, installation of base system, and
preconfiguration of a minimal amount of services and settings that Fuel
requires to be able to manage this node after rebooting it into the
installed system.
