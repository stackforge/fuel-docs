Nailgun extension
-----------------

An isolated code piece that you can keep in a separate repository and
you can plug in and out. The nailgun extension can introduce additional
API handlers, callbacks, and embeds itself into the attributes serialization
pipeline.

You can use the extensions to integrate into the deployment pipeline
third-party services, such as LDAP or your own configuration management
database.
