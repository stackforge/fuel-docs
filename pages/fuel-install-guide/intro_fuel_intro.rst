Introduction to Fuel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fuel is an open-source software application that simplifies the deployment of
highly available OpenStack environments, as well as enables you to monitor
and manage your OpenStack environments after deployment.

Fuel provides graphical user interface (GUI), as well as command-line user
interface (CLI) and RESTful API for provisioning, configuration, and
management of the OpenStack environments.

Using Fuel you can:

- Deploy multiple highly-available OpenStack environments on virtual or bare
  metal hardware.

- Provision and verify network configurations.

- Test interoperability between the OpenStack components.

- Manage the OpenStack resources after deployment.
