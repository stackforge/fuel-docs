Patching
++++++++

The patching feature introduced in Mirantis OpenStack 6.1
is the process of delivering product updates to users which can be
applied using standard Linux commands (e.g. ``apt-get`` and ``yum``).

The patching feature allows you to keep your
environment up-to-date in a customized fashion without
the need to upgrade to the latest version.

For your user experience and how-to see :ref:`Applying patches<patching-ops>`.

.. note::
   The patching feature is introduced in
   Mirantis OpenStack 6.1 and will not work in older releases.
