Ceilometer can use an external MongoDB installation (experimental)
------------------------------------------------------------------

The ability to configure :ref:`Ceilometer<ceilometer-term>`
to use an external MongoDB cluster
instead of MongoDB nodes that are deployed by Fuel
as part of the OpenStack environment
is an :ref:`experimental feature<experimental-features-term>`
that is enhanced in 6.1.
See the `Implement possibility to set external MongoDB connection
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/external-mongodb-support>`_
blueprint for implementation details.
