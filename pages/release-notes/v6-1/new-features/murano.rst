Murano-related features
-----------------------

* New OpenStack application catalog was published to
  `Community App Catalog <http://apps.openstack.org/>`_, enabling users to
  select Murano packages, Heat templates, and Glance images they would
  like to add to their cloud.

* Users can source Murano packages and their dependencies using a URL
  (package name) from `Community App Catalog <http://apps.openstack.org/>`_
  instead of using a zip file, simplifying Murano workflow.
  See `the related blueprint <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/murano/+spec/muraniclient-url-download>`__.
