Support for Operating System (base-os) role
-------------------------------------------

With Fuel 6.1 you are now able deploy
an empty role that you can then customize
to what fits your needs.

See `Blueprint: Allow generic linux install with no additional packages...
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/blank-role-node>`_.

See :ref:`Deploying an empty role <deploy-empty-role>` for detailed instructions.
