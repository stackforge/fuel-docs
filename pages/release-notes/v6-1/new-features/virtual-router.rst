Virtual Router for public-less nodes
------------------------------------

With Fuel 6.1, Slave nodes
that do not have public interface can now
connect to the public networks without the
Fuel Master node as the default gateway.

See `Blueprint for Virtual router for env's nodes <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/virtual-router-for-env-nodes>`_ for details.
