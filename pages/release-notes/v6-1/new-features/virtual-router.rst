Virtual Router for target nodes
-------------------------------

With Fuel 6.1, Controller nodes can now
connect to the public networks without the
Fuel Master node as the default gateway.

You can specify the following values
for the Controller nodes:

 * DNS-servers
 * NTP-servers
 * Public Virtual IP for Virtual Router
 * Management Virtual IP for Virtual Router

See `Blueprint for Virtual router for env's nodes
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/virtual-router-for-env-nodes>`_ for details.
