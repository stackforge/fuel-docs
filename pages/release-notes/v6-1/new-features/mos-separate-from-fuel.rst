Starting with Fuel 6.1, the repositories for
Mirantis OpenStack and Linux packages are separate.
You can now run base distributive updates and Mirantis OpenStack updates
separately during the product life cycle.

For a detailed description
see `Separate Mirantis OpenStack and Linux Repositories <https://docs.fuel-infra.org/fuel-dev/develop/separateMOS.html>`_.
