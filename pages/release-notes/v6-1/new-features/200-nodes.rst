Scalability certification for 200-node environments
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Environments deployed with Fuel 6.1
are certified as stable and scalable
at up to 200 nodes.
We are continuing to work to eliminate stability, scalability,
and performance issues for larger environments.
See the `200 nodes support
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/200-nodes-support>`_
blueprint for details about the implementation.
