The Fuel web UI reminds about network verification before deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fuel web UI now provides messages

button:

* if you forgot to verify networks

* if the verification failed

* if verification is in progress

See :ref:`Verify networks <verify-networks-ug>` for more details and screenshots.
