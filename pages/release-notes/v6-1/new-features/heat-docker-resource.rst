Heat Docker Resource enabled by default
---------------------------------------

Mirantis OpenStack 6.1 enables Docker Resource for
Heat by default. Now it can be used by Murano without additional
deployment workarounds. As being installed
on the deployment step, Docker Resource is available for
Heat on its first launch. Use the **heat resource-list**
command to view the list of available resources.

For more details, see the `Enable Heat Docker resource by default
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/mos/+spec/heat-docker-resource-by-default>`_
blueprint.
