Nova-related features
---------------------

Instance features
+++++++++++++++++

* Users are allowed to `specify an image to use for rescue`_ instead of
  the original base image.
  See also the `API: Allow user to specify image to use during rescue`_ blueprint
  and the `Allow image to be specified during rescue`_ specification for details.

* Allow images to specify whether a config drive should be used.
  See the `Consider the image property for config drive option`_ blueprint
  and the `Config drive based on image property`_ specification for details.

* Users and administrators can control the vCPU topology exposed to
  guests via flavors.
  See the `Virt driver guest vCPU topology configuration`_ specification for details.

* All local disks are attached during rescue.
  See the `Attach All Disks During Rescue (partial)`_ blueprint
  and the `Attach All Local Disks During Rescue`_ specification for details.


Networking
++++++++++

* Nova-network allows per-network settings.
  See the `Better Support for Multiple Networks in nova-network (partial)`_ blueprint
  and the `Better Support for Multiple Networks in nova-network`_ specification for details.

* Allow deployers to add hooks which are informed as soon as networking
  information for an instance is changed.
  See the `Add hook for update_instance_cache_with_nw_info`_ specification for details.

* Permit VM instances to attach multiple interfaces to one network.
  See the `Support multiple interfaces from one VM attached to the same network`_
  specification for details.

* VM instances can now be booted up with SR-IOV neutron ports.
  See the `enable a nova instance to be booted up with neutron SRIOV ports`_ blueprint
  and the `PCI SR-IOV passthrough to nova instance`_ specification for details.


Scheduling
++++++++++

* Resource tracker is now pluggable.
  See the `Scheduler: Extensible Resource Tracking (partial)`_ blueprint
  and the `Extensible Resource Tracking`_ specification for details.

* It is no longer required to specify a target host when evacuating
  instances.
  See the `API: Evacuate instance to a scheduled host`_ specification for details.

* Status of a host in the database is now updated only when it is changed, instead
  of every 60 seconds.
  See the `Change compute updates from periodic to on demand`_ specification for details.


Other
+++++

* Status information is now included in API listings of hypervisor hosts.
  See the `Return hypervisor node status`_ specification for details.

* API callers can now specify more than one status to filter by when listing VMs.
  See the `servers list API support specify multi-status`_ specification for details.

* New quota values have been added to constrain the number and size of server
  groups a user can create.
  See the `Server Group Quotas`_ specification for details.


Libvirt specific
++++++++++++++++

* Performance of listing instances on modern libvirt versions
  has been improved.
  See the `Speedup listing of domains in libvirt driver (partial)`_ blueprint
  and the `Speedup listing of domains in libvirt driver`_ specification for details.

* Meta-data about an instance is now recorded in the libvirt domain XML.
  This is intended to help administrators while debugging problems.
  See the `Libvirt driver domain metadata`_ specification for details.

* Add support for handing back unused disk blocks to the underlying storage system:
  the ``hw_disk_discard`` configuration option.
  See the `Libvirt-Enable suppport for discard option for disks managed by nova`_
  blueprint, the `Libvirt-Enable support discard option for disk device`_
  specification, and the `New options in Juno for OpenStack Compute`_ reference for details.

* Copy-on-write cloning for RBD-backed disks is now enabled.
  See the `Storage: Copy-on-write cloning for RBD-backed disks`_ specification for details.

* Allow controlled shutdown of guest operating systems during VM power off.
  See the `Allow Users to specify Guest shutdown behavior for Stop, Rescue,
  and Delete (partial)`_ blueprint and the `Allow controlled shutdown of GuestOS
  for operations which power off the VM`_ specification for details.
