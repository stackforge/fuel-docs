Nodes can be removed from Fuel inventory
----------------------------------------

If the node is dead or there is need
to remove it from the cluster,
you can now move it right from the Fuel inventory.
See :ref:`Assign a role or roles to each node server <assign-roles-ug>`
For instructions on deleting any node from inventory
using the
Fuel CLI, see :ref:`Remove a node from Fuel DB <remove-inv>`.
