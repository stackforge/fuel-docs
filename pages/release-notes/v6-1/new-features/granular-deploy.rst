Granular deployment based on tasks
----------------------------------

Fuel 6.1 provides
`granular deployment <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/granular-deployment-based-on-tasks>`_
based on tasks.
That means, you can use several parameters
to meet the requirements for deployment.
For example, this can be done with
chanding ``id``, ``stage``, ``group`` and some other
options. For instructions, see TDB.
Note, that you can not only
form your deployment criteria,
but also render graphs;
see TBD for more details.
