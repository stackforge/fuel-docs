Enhancements to Fuel Agent for Image-based provisioning (experimental)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fuel Agent,
an :ref:`experimental feature<experimental-features-term>`
that uses images to install the operating system
on the target nodes instead of using customized versions
of the native operating system installation scripts,
is enhanced in 6.1.
