How to Obtain the Product
=========================


Mirantis OpenStack is distributed as
a self-contained ISO.
You can download the ISO in
`the Mirantis OpenStack download section <https://software.mirantis.com/openstack-download-form/>`_ of the Mirantis Portal.
We have also created Oracle VirtualBox scripts to enable quick and easy deployment of a multi-node OpenStack cloud for evaluation purposes; see :ref:`Running Mirantis OpenStack on VirtualBox <virtualbox>`.
