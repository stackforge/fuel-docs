Network verification issues
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Network verification does not fail anymore if a node is offline, as
net_checker does not try to check offline nodes. The appropriate
notice is generated when a node is offline, which implies this node
will not be tested.
It will issue an error without starting if there are fewer than two
online nodes.
