Fuel Plugins
============

* The Fuel web UI progress bar
  does not display the actual
  plugin deployment workflow. Plugins go through
  several stages like pre-deployment and
  post-deployment. Nevertheless, progress bar
  of the Fuel web UI
  provides no information about them; instead,
  both stages can still be in progress while
  all nodes appear as *Ready* and the bar shows 100%
  completion.
