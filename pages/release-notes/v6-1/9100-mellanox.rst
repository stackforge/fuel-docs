Known limitations for the Mellanox SR-IOV plugin
------------------------------------------------

In 6.1 release, Mellanox
is supported in :ref:`Experimental Mode <experimental-features-term>` only.
Nevertheless, it is no recommended
to use Mellanox features in this mode
as the whole upstream feature is deprecated and is not verified.
Please, use the Mellanox plugin instead;
you can download it from the
`Fuel Plugin Catalog <https://www.mirantis.com/products/openstack-drivers-and-plugins/fuel-plugins/>`_.
