Storage technologies Issues
===========================


Resolved storage technologies issues
------------------------------------

* Cinder-backup service is now enabled for environments with Ceph
  running as Cinder back end.
  See `LP1411635 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1411635>`_.

* Enabling the *Assign public network to all nodes* option on the
  *Settings* tab of the Fuel web UI no longer
  uses the default gateway from Storage network, and does not
  make the Internet host unreachable.
  See `LP1404809 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1404809>`_.

Known storage technologies issues
---------------------------------

* Placing Ceph OSD on Controllers is not recommended because it can severely
  degrade controller's performance.
  It is better to use separate storage nodes
  if you have enough hardware.

* You may experience some performance drop on CEPH
  on disks with 4 KB sector size, since the default
  sector size for operation is 512-bytes.
