OpenStack Orchestration (Heat)
------------------------------

Known Heat issues
+++++++++++++++++

* For the time being, the default Heat configuration for HA
  environments is set to False. It may lead to the Heat failures in
  destructive scenarios (when you power off some controllers, for
  example). See `LP1465840`_.

  As a workaround, change the parameter to ``rabbit_ha_queues=True``
  in the ``/etc/heat/heat.conf`` configuration file. Once you change
  the Heat configuration files on all the controllers, manually
  restart all the Heat services on all the OpenStack controllers::

   # service heat-api restart
   # service heat-engine restart
   # service heat-api-cfn restart
   # service heat-api-cloudwatch restart
