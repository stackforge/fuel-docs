OpenStack Image (Glance)
------------------------

Resolved Glance issues
++++++++++++++++++++++

* In case of slow connection to the external storage, Glance
  was not able to upload an image. It happened because of a one-minute
  timeout that broke connection if 16 MB chunk had not been
  downloaded within that time period. To prevent these timeouts,
  the chunk size is reduced to 4 MB. See `LP1401118`_.

* The token caching was disabled for ``glance-api`` to prevent
  authentication errors. See `LP1443913`_.

Known Glance issues
+++++++++++++++++++

* A big image cannot be uploaded and an instance snapshot will fail
  if the upload image time is longer than the Keystone token lifespan.
  Glance returns an authentication failure indicating that
  the token is invalid. See `LP1456573`_ and `LP1441156`_.

* After all the Ceph compute nodes destruction followed by their
  recreation and the environment redeployment, ``glance-api`` stops
  responding (with an HTTP 503 error). As a workaround, restart the
  ``glance-api`` service. For more information, see `LP1459743`_.

* Glance may create unjustified CPU load on a standby cluster.
  The issue is with the multiple concurrent actions with the
  cloud (e.g. various CRUD operations) performed by users.
  Each new action may create a heavier load on the CPU.
  The workaround is to restart the affected service, which will
  drop back the CPU consumption by the service to almost zero.
  See `LP1463522`_.

* An attempt to create a Glance image with incorrect checksum
  results in a 500 error. See `LP1452712`_.
