OpenStack Compute (Nova)
------------------------

Resolved Nova issues
++++++++++++++++++++

* An encrypted volume can now be successfully attached to an instance.
  See `LP1420849`_.

Known Nova issues
+++++++++++++++++

* Occasionally, nova-api process starts using too much RAM (>2 GB).
  This is a known, hard-to-reproduce issue. The workaround is to
  restart the nova-api service.
  See `LP1427688`_.

* Live migration with the specified destination host does not currently use
  the same memory oversubscription logic as during an instance boot.
  This may cause migrations to fail due to not enough amount of memory.
  See `LP1452009`_.

* An instance may hang with a kernel panic after the live migration
  operation completes successfully. This only affects pure QEMU
  virtualization. We recommend using offline migration of instances
  until the issue is resolved.
  See `LP1371130`_.
