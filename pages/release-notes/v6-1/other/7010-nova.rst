OpenStack Compute (Nova)
------------------------

Resolved Nova Issues
++++++++++++++++++++

* The encrypted volume can be successfully attached to an instance now.
  See `LP1420849`_.

Known Nova Issues
+++++++++++++++++

* Occasionally, nova-api process starts using too much RAM (>2 GB).
  This is a known, hard-to-reproduce issue. The workaround is to
  restart the nova-api service.
  See `LP1427688`_.

* Live migration with the specified destination host should use
  the same memory oversubscription logic as during an instance boot.
  See `LP1452009`_.

* An instance may hang with a kernel panic after the live migration
  operation completes successfully. This only affects pure QEMU
  virtualization. We recommend using offline migration of instances
  until the issue is resolved.
  See `LP1371130`_.
