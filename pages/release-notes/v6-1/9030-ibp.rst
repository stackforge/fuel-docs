Issues with Image Based Provisioning
====================================

Known issues with image based provisioning
------------------------------------------

Rebooting any node of a cluster with a Ubuntu image based provisioning
two times in a row will stop at the GRUB screen. The node will not
automatically boot until the user selects an option in the GRUB menu.
There is no timeout.
