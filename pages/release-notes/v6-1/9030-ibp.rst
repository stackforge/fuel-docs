Issues with Image Based Provisioning
====================================

Known issues with image based provisioning
------------------------------------------

Rebooting any node of a cluster with a Ubuntu image based provisioning
two times in a row will stop at the GRUB screen. The node will not
automatically boot until the user selects an option in the GRUB menu.
There is no timeout.
See `LP1465586 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1465586>`_.

Image building requires using a high I/O rate disk on the Fuel Master
node when depoyed over a QEMU/KVM virtual machine. The issue is that
with the default disk settings the operation is likely to time out
before the building process completes successfully and will error
out with the "Provision timeout" message.
