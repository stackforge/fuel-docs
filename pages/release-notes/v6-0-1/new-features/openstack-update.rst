Fuel 6.0 can update existing 5.x Mirantis OpenStack environments (experimental)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An :ref:`experimental feature<experimental-features-term>`
enables the Fuel Master Node to update existing environments
to more recent maintenance releases within the same release series
(for example, in the Icehouse release,
one could update from 5.0 or 5.0.1 to 5.0.2,
or 5.1 to 5.1.1).
Once the Fuel Master Node is upgraded,
Fuel provides an option to update an existing environment.

Mirantis OpenStack 6.0 is the first release based on Juno,
and so no OpenStack environment update options
are included in this release.
We expect to offer the ability to update a 6.0 environment
to future releases of the Juno based 6.x release series.
