Pluggable Architecture
----------------------

Fuel 6.0 supports a Pluggable Architecture that allows new functionality to be
added to Fuel from a self-contained archive. Tools are provided that allow
contributors to package and test Fuel plug-ins.

To install a plug-in, you should download it from the
Mirantis web page and follow installation instructions.
Note that some plug-ins have prerequisites, limitations
and also need additional configuration.
