Collection of Statistics
------------------------

Mirantis OpenStack 6.0 includes the option to help us to improve your
experience by sending Mirantis information about the settings, features, and
deployment actions when you use Mirantis OpenStack. The anonymous collection of
statistics is on by default; during installation, you can opt out of statistics
collection.

* Anonymous usage statistics include information such as settings, actions,
  hardware configuration, and version information.

* The usage statistics do not include information such as passwords, IP
  addresses, or node names.

* You may choose to identify your usage reports with your contact information
  so that our support team can better assist you. This is entirely optional and
  enabled only with your permission.

(“Privacy Policy”) describes our practices regarding the information we collect
on the Mirantis web sites and through the use of our products and services, and
how it is used and shared with third parties. See the `Send usage
