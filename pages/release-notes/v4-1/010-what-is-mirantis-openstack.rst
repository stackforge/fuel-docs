What is Mirantis OpenStack?
===========================

Mirantis OpenStack is made up of three components:

* Fuel for OpenStack
* Mirantis OpenStack hardened packages
* Mirantis Support

Fuel for OpenStack
------------------

Fuel is a lifecycle management application that deploys multiple
`OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org/>`_ clouds
from a single interface and then enables you to manage those clouds post deployment.
You can add nodes, remove nodes, or even remove clouds,
restoring those resources to the available resources pool.
Fuel also eases the complexities of network and storage configurations
through a simple-to-use graphical user experience. Baked into Fuel are:

* Mirantis reference architectures that we have tested and certified
  to ensure that your deployed clouds are scalable, reliable, and production quality.
* An open and flexible library that enables customers to make configuration changes
  that may be more advanced or focused than the default choices within Fuel.
  This library also empowers organizations to fold additional drivers
  or integrations into the deployed environment.

Mirantis OpenStack hardened packages
------------------------------------

These packages include the core OpenStack projects,
updated with each stable release of OpenStack,
and supporting a broad range of operating systems, hypervisors, and deployment topologies.
Also included are:

* Packages to ensure High Availability.
* Any defect fixes reported by our customers that may not yet have been merged into the community source.
* Mirantis-driven premium OpenStack projects
  such as Savanna (which provides a simple means to provision a Hadoop cluster on top of OpenStack)
  and Murano (that enables you to deploy data center services such as Windows and Linux on OpenStack.
* Mirantis-certified partner plug-ins, drivers, and integrations.

Mirantis Support
----------------

Mirantis OpenStack offers a subscription to our world-class support
with defined service level agreements based on the severity of your issue.
For example, the premium support guarantees a one-hour response for severity 1 issues.
