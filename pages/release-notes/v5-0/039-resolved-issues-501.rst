Issues Resolved in Mirantis OpenStack 5.0.1
===========================================

Bootstrap kernel supports additional hardware
---------------------------------------------

The bootstrap image shipped with earlier versions of Mirantis OpenStack
omitted some firmware files,
which led to issues with some hardware configurations
(e.g. Dell R410/R610s and other servers with Broadcom NetXteme II NICs).
The bootstrap image shipped with Mirantis OpenStack 5.0.1
has been updated to include these firmware files.
See `LP1323354 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1323354>`_
for details.

AMQP heartbeat and other HA improvements
----------------------------------------

Heartbeat mechanism is added to the oslo.messaging library (used for
AMQP based RPC between OpenStack components) to detect and drop hung
RabbitMQ sessions and force a reconnect to a healthy controller.

The AMQP heartbeat has to be enabled because the interaction between
Linux TCP/IP stack, AMQP protocol, its implementation in pyamqp and
kombo libraries for Python, OpenStack oslo.messaging library, and the
Eventlet networking library for Python can result in hung RabbitMQ
sessions when a controller node goes offline.

When that happens, RPC fails for one or more OpenStack components and
major areas of functionality, such as provisioning instances or
attaching volumes, are blocked. Without the heartbeat, you would have to
restart the affected services to recover.
See `LP1341656 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1341656>`_.

Syslog log rotation on the Fuel Master Node
-------------------------------------------

Multiple inconsistencies in the syslog rotation implementation
are fixed:

- The syslog log rotation on the Fuel Master Node
  has been reimplemented to integrate docker logs with other logs,
  to add audit logs to the rotation,
  and to split client logs from server logs.
  See `LP1316957 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1316957>`_.

- Issues that caused duplicated entries in syslog
  and that prevented the log rotation scheme from clearing these logs
  could cause the logs to grow to the point
  where they filled the file system on the Fuel Master Node.
  These have been fixed.
  See `LP1329991 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1329991>`_.

Health Check sometimes returned false positive error
----------------------------------------------------

In earlier releases, the Fuel Health Check sometimes
erroneously reported an error
when checking connectivity using a floating IP.
This was fixed by increasing the maximum number of ping probes
to allow at least three answers for up to ten requests,
increasing the interval between connectivity checks
from thirty seconds to sixty seconds,
and checking the command result rather than its output.
A retry is also implemented
when the ping command returns with an error code.
See `LP1322102 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1322102>`_.

Stopping deployment could damage filesystem
-------------------------------------------

Clicking the "Stop Deployment" button when modifying
a provisioned node sometimes destroyed the nodes's filesystem.
This happened because Astute removed the node from Cobbler,
making the node's hostname unresolvable.
It was fixed by modifying the stop_provisioning task
to use the node's IP address rather than hostname.
See `LP1316583 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1316583>`_.

Unable to restart deployment
----------------------------

If you stopped deployment when a controller node
was partially deployed,
restarting the deployment raised a 400 error
with the "No changes to deploy" text.
After a few minutes, the node's status would change
to "discovered" although the pending_addition flag was not set.
This was because Nailgun was not sent all the information
it needed to continue the deployment.
This problem has been fixed.
See `LP1319823 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1319823>`_.

Cobbler sometimes ran out of resources when redeploying environment
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Redeploying an OpenStack environment
requires that Cobbler delete existing nodes
and then redeploy them,
which sometimes caused Cobbler to run out of resources.
To fix this problem,
nodes are now split into smaller groups
which are processed in order
with some lag time (configurable, default 10 seconds)
between the processing of the groups.
See `LP1339024 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1339024>`_.

Race condition in Nailgun may hang Fuel UI
------------------------------------------

A race condition in Nailgun
could cause the UI to freeze
and Fuel CLI and API to start reporting Internal Server Error
as a response to any command.
Upgrading the Fuel Master Node to 5.0.1
unfreezes the environment
and prevents it from happening again for a new environment.
See `LP1328200 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1328200>`_.

Instance console sometimes failed to connect
--------------------------------------------

For cloud environments with multiple Controller nodes,
the first attempt to access the Horizon Instance console
sometimes failed
although subsequent attempts to connect were successful.
The solution was to use the Nova memcached_servers configuration option
to ensure that authentication tokens used to connect to instance consoles
are shared properly across all Controller nodes.
See `LP1323705 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1323705>`_.

Ceilometer performance issues
-----------------------------

The method used to do reverse DNS lookups for Ceilometer
was inappropriate, which caused serious latency issues.
This has been resolved.
See `LP1330951 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1330951>`_,
`LP1324140 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1324140>`_,
and `LP1291229 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+bug/1291229>`_.

Problems deploying Ceph OSD nodes when redeploying environment
--------------------------------------------------------------

LVM metadata was sometimes retained
when a new OpenStack cloud environment was deployed
using the same hardware and the same partition layout as the old environment;
this prevented Ceph OSD nodes from deploying correctly.
LVM metadata is now explicitly erased from all partitions
after the partitions are created
during the provisioning of a node for the new environment;
this solves the problem.
See `LP1323707 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1323707>`_.

Deployment failed because of unnecessary HAProxy backend status check on secondary controller
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HAProxy backend status is only necessary on the primary controller.
When run on a secondary controller,
the check may run at the wrong time and report a failure,
which caused the deployment of the whole environment to fail.
In 5.0.1, HAProxy backend check
runs only during deployment of primary controller.
See `LP1329780 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1329780>`_.

Rebooting Fuel Master Node from installation media silently deleted partitions on target nodes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Fuel Master Node was accidentally rebooted
from the installation media after deployment,
it silently wiped the partition table on the target nodes.
In 5.0.1, Fuel asks for confirmation before
wiping the disks on the target nodes.
See `LP1325068 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1325068>`_.

Number of Ceph OSD Journal Partitions is no longer limited
----------------------------------------------------------

In earlier releases,
double-digit partitions (10 and up)
on the Ceph OSD Journal device
could not be allocated to Ceph OSDs.
This limitation has been removed.
See `LP1339833 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1339833>`_.

The network settings tab disappeared intermittently on a VirtualBox deployment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Network Settings tab sometimes disappeared
from the Fuel UI screen on a VirtualBox deployment
and then reappeared.
This has been fixed.
See `LP1323269 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1323269>`_.

Murano Health Check no longer downloads images for testing
----------------------------------------------------------

Before running the Murano Health Check,
you should manually download the image
as documented in :ref:`murano-test-prepare`.
In earlier versions of Fuel,
if the image was not present,
the software would attempt to download the image
from a standard site and generate an error when it was not found.
Now the test fails if the image is not available on the target.
See `LP1327290 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1327290>`_.

Live Migration now works when the instance has floating IP assigned
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In previous releases,
the migration process failed when the instance
had a floating IP address assigned.
This was due to incorrect type handling
for a floating IP object in Nova;
the problem has now been fixed.
