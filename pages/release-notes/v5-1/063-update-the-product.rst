How to Update the Product
=========================

You can easily update your Mirantis OpenStack using the introduced
update mechanism without a need to redeploy it completely.

.. warning:: Updating Mirantis OpenStack deployment could override
   manually applied custom patches and will cause downtime of the
   entire environment, hence a maintenance window needs to be planned.
   It is highly recommended that you backup your deployment before
   applying updates. Please consult Mirantis Support if you have any
   questions or concerns.

.. note::
      During the updating procedure only Mirantis OpenStack services
      will be updated. No update of an underlying Operating System
      will occur within the scope of Mirantis OpenStack Maintenance
      Update.

Please follow the instruction below to install updates.

Automated way to install updates to all nodes
---------------------------------------------
Run the following command on the Fuel Master node to obtain a local
mirror of the updates repository:

Version 5.1::

       rsync -vap --chmod=Dugo+x \
       rsync://fuel-repository.mirantis.com/mirror/fwm/5.1/updates/ /var/www/nailgun/updates/

Version 5.1.1::

       rsync -vap --chmod=Dugo+x \
       rsync://fuel-repository.mirantis.com/mirror/fwm/5.1.1/updates/ /var/www/nailgun/updates/

.. note::
      You must have an access to the Internet on the Fuel
      Master node to download the repository.

After rsyncâ€™ing the updates repository from the Mirantis mirror to
the Fuel Master node internal repository, a special script can be
used for the automated update of the nodes in all or particular
environments:

       `mos_apply_mu.py <https://review.fuel-infra.org/gitweb?p=tools/sustaining.git;a=blob_plain;f=scripts/mos_apply_mu.py;hb=refs/heads/master>`_

This script updates all nodes one by one and should be run on the
Fuel Master node in the following manner in order to update nodes in
the environment `X` given that IP address of the Fuel Master node is
10.20.0.2, Fuel user name is `user_name`, password is `user_password`
and tenant_name is `tenant_name`::

       python mos_apply_mu.py --env-id=X --update --master-ip=10.20.0.2 \
       --user=user_name --pass=user_password --tenant=tenant_name

To update all environments, use `--all-envs` option::

       python mos_apply_mu.py --update --all-envs --master-ip=10.20.0.2 \
       --user=user_name --pass=user_password --tenant=tenant_name

The status of the update process can be checked by using `--check`
option::

       python mos_apply_mu.py --check --all-envs --master-ip=10.20.0.2 \
       --user=user_name --pass=user_password --tenant=tenant_name

The script will update all online nodes in all environments with
respect to the version of an operating system in a particular
environment. You can find your environment id in the list by running
the following command on the Fuel Master node::

       fuel env

To get the list of available options, run the script without
parameters::

       python mos_apply_mu.py

.. note::
      The script uses :ref:`Keystone<keystone-term>`'s authentication
      in order to obtain nodes list from Fuel API, thus access
      credentials must be provided.
      ``--user``, ``--pass``, ``--tenant`` options must be set
      properly.

All output from nodes can be found in `/var/log/remote/$ip$/nodes-update.log`
where $ip$ the IP address of particular node.

Manual updating procedure for Linux CentOS- and Ubuntu-based nodes
------------------------------------------------------------------

To be able to update the nodes of your environment you should setup
local updates repository on the Fuel Master node and use it as an
update mirror.
Run the following command on the Fuel Master node to obtain a local
mirror of the updates repository:

Version 5.1::

       rsync -vap --chmod=Dugo+x \
       rsync://fuel-repository.mirantis.com/mirror/fwm/5.1/updates/ /var/www/nailgun/updates/

Version 5.1.1::

       rsync -vap --chmod=Dugo+x \
       rsync://fuel-repository.mirantis.com/mirror/fwm/5.1.1/updates/ /var/www/nailgun/updates/

.. note::
      Note that you must have an access to the Internet on the Fuel
      Master node to download the repository.

Ubuntu-based deployments
------------------------

#. Add the updates repository into the system using the following
   command on each node::

       echo -e "\ndeb http://<FUEL-MASTER-IP>:8080/updates/ubuntu precise main" \
       >> /etc/apt/sources.list

#. To update indexes, run::

       apt-get update

#. To upgrade packages, run::

       apt-get upgrade

CentOS-based deployments
------------------------

#. Add repository into the system using the following command::

       yum-config-manager --add-repo=http://<FUEL-MASTER-IP>:8080/updates/centos/os/x86_64/

#. To update packages, run::

       yum update --skip-broken

.. note::
      Due to ruby21 installation method (its dependencies are not
      present in the repository), the ``--skip-broken`` flag is
      required.

.. note::
      After updating on all nodes OpenStack services need to be
      restarted manually for updates to take effect.
      HA-enabled services on controller nodes should be restarted
      using ``crm resource restart`` while non-HA services should be
      restarted using a native OS service manager.
      In standard Mirantis OpenStack HA environment the following
      services are deployed as HA-enabled: ``p_neutron-l3-agent``,
      ``p_neutron-metadata-agent``, ``p_neutron-dhcp-agent``,
      ``p_neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent``, ``p_heat-engine``.
      On compute nodes all OpenStack services should be restarted
      using a native OS service manager.
