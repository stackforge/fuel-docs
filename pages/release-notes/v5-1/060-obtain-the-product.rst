How to Obtain the Product
=========================

Mirantis OpenStack is distributed as a self-contained ISO or IMG that,
once downloaded, does not require Internet access to provision OpenStack nodes
if you deploy it using the Mirantis OpenStack hardened packages.
The ISO and IMG files are available in the Mirantis OpenStack download section
of the `Mirantis Portal <http://software.mirantis.com>`_.
Here, you will also find the Oracle VirtualBox scripts
to enable quick and easy deployment of a multi-node OpenStack cloud for evaluation purposes;
see the `0 to OpenStack in 60 Minutes or less
<https://software.mirantis.com/quick-start/>`_.

Mirantis OpenStack is also available on-demand,
preconfigured, and ready to use
with our Hosted Private Cloud product,
`Mirantis OpenStack Express <https://express.mirantis.com/home>`_.
