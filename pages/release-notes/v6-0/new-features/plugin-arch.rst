Pluggable Architecture
----------------------

Fuel 6.0 supports a Pluggable Architecture that allows new functionality to be
added to Fuel from a self-contained archive. Tools are provided that allow
contributors to package and test Fuel plugins.

To install a plug-in, you should download it from
`<https://software.mirantis.com/fuel-plugins>`_ Mirantis web page,
copy to the Fuel Master node and enable the plug-in on the *Settings* tab
of the Fuel web UI. Note that you can enable a plug-in
only before your environment is deployed.
