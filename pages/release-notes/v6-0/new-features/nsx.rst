Support for vCenter with NSX (experimental)
-------------------------------------------

In Experimental mode, Fuel 6.0 can deploy an environment that uses
both :ref:`vCenter<vcenter-term>`
as a hypervisor and :ref:`NSX<nsx-term>` as a networking option.
If you plan to use NSX with vCenter, see :ref:`nsx-plan`.
For instructions on enabling NSX in Experimental mode,
see :ref:`experimental-features-op`.
