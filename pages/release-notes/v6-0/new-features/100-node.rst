Scalability Certification for 100-node environments
---------------------------------------------------

Environments deployed with Fuel 6.0
are being certified as stable and scalable
at up to 100 nodes.
We continue to work to eliminate stability, scalability,
and performance issues for large environments.
See the `100 nodes support
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/100-nodes-support>`_
blueprint for details about the implementation.
