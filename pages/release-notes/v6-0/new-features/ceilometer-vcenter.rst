Ceilometer can collect statistics in vCenter environment (experimental)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fuel can now install a Ceilometer agent on the Controller node where the
Compute role is installed when deploying a vCenter environment. Operators can
then configure Ceilometer to collect metrics for the vCenter environment; see
:ref:`ceilometer-vcenter`. See the
`Implement possibility to setup ceilometer compute agent on controller
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/ceilometer-support-for-vcenter>`_
blueprint for implementation details.
