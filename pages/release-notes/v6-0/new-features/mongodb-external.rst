Ceilometer can use an external MongoDB installation (experimental)
------------------------------------------------------------------

As an :ref:`experimental feature<experimental-features-term>`, Fuel 6.0 can
configure :ref:`Ceilometer<ceilometer-term>` to use an external MongoDB cluster
instead of MongoDB nodes that are deployed by Fuel as part of the OpenStack
environment. See the `Implement possibility to set external MongoDB connection
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/external-mongodb-support>`_
blueprint for implementation details.
