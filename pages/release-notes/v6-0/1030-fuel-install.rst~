Fuel Installation and Deployment Issues
=======================================

Known Issues in 6.0
-------------------

Master node installation fails if installed from USB flash drive
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Symptoms**

1. You download the Mirantis OpenStack 6.0 IMG file;
2. You put the file on a USB flash drive and run the installation;
3. The installation completes without any errors;
4. The installed Fuel Master Node does not have properly placed Puppet manifests and is unusable.

**Cause**

The USB image has the full ISO image inside and an additional copy of kickstart file external to the embedded ISO image.
This additional kickstart searches for the openstack_version file and fails, since there is no copy of this file nearby outside the ISO image.
As a result, malformed paths are used for the remaining kickstart commands.

**Solution**

This has been fixed.

Check the MD5 checksum of your copy of Mirantis OpenStack 6.0 IMG file.
If the checksum is 3e0ad93d6c6b874478e1ea7b4f7d871a, then you have a corrupt IMG file and can either redownload the correct IMG file or apply a patch.

* `Redownload the correct Mirantis OpenStack 6.0 IMG file <http://drive.google.com/a/mirantis.com/file/d/0BybDDjx4oqkYMzVtTzZUSlF3MDQ/view?usp=sharing>`_. The MD5 checksum for the correct file is b4b1ec2f2a12beb20eaaf6f14511d512.

OR

* `Download and apply a patch script <https://launchpadlibrarian.net/196168950/MirantisOpenStack-6.0.img.patch.sh>`_:

  1. Put the downloaded script in the same directory with the corrupt IMG file.
  2. Run the script with the three following options one by one:

     <sudo ./MirantisOpenStack-6.0.img.patch.sh mount>
     <sudo ./MirantisOpenStack-6.0.img.patch.sh patch>
     <sudo ./MirantisOpenStack-6.0.img.patch.sh umount>

Fuel may not allocate enough IP addresses for expansion
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The pool of IP addresses to be used by all nodes
in the OpenStack environment
is allocated when the Fuel Master Node is initially deployed.
The IP settings cannot be changed
after the initial boot of the Fuel Master Node.
This may mean that the IP pool
is too small to support additional nodes
added to the environment
without redeploying the environment.
See :ref:`public-floating-ips-arch`
for more information.
See `LP1271571 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1271571>`_
for a detailed description of the issues
and pointers to blueprints of proposed solutions.

GRE-enabled Neutron installation runs inter VM traffic through management network
>>>>>>> 1ef7e45... Adds a known issue on Master node installation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In Neutron GRE installations configured with the Fuel UI,
a single physical interface is used
for both OpenStack management traffic and VM-to-VM communications.
This limitation only affects implementations deployed using the Fuel UI;
you can use the :ref:`Fuel CLI<cli_usage>` to use other physical interfaces
when you configure your environment.
See `LP1285059 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1285059>`_.

Fuel default disk partition scheme is sub-optimal
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* All available hardware LUNs under LVM are used and spanned across;
  for example, OpenStack and guest traffic are coupled.
  See the
  `Improve Fuel Default Disk Partition Scheme
  <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/improve-fuel-default-disk-partition-scheme>`_ blueprint.

* On target nodes that use Ubuntu as the operating system,
  Ubuntu provisioning applies the default Base System partition
  even if the user choses a different scheme.

New node may not boot because of IOMMU issues
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A new node fails when trying to boot into bootstrap.
To fix this issue,
add the "intel_iommu=off" or "amd_iommu=off" kernel parameter
on the Fuel Master node;
follow instructions in :ref:`kernel-parameters-ops`.
See `LP1324483 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1324483>`_.

Anaconda fails with LVME error on CentOS
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Anaconda fails with LVME error: deployment was aborted by provisioning timeout,
because installation of CentOS failed on one of compute nodes.
See `LP1321790 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1321790>`_.
This is related to known issues with Anaconda.

Invalid node status after restoring Fuel Master node from backup
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you add nodes to the environment after you create a
:ref:`backup<Backup_and_restore_Fuel_Master>`
and subsequently restore the Fuel Master,
those nodes may be reported as offline.
Rebooting those nodes brings them back online.
To avoid this problem, always run a new backup
of the Fuel Master node after adding nodes.
See `LP1347718 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1347718>`_.

Shotgun does not check available disk space before taking a diagnostic snapshot
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Shotgun does not ensure that adequate disk space is available
for the diagnostic snapshot.
Users should manually verify the disk space
before taking a diagnostic snapshot.
See `LP1328879 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1328879>`_
and the `blueprint <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/manage-logs-with-free-space-consideration>`_.


Other Issues
++++++++++++

* The Fuel Master Node can only be installed with CentOS as the host OS.
  While Mirantis OpenStack nodes can be installed
  with either Ubuntu or CentOS as the host OS,
  the Fuel Master Node is only supported on CentOS.

* Deployments done through the Fuel UI
  create all of the networks on all servers
  even if they are not required by a specific role.
  For example, a Cinder node has VLANs created
  and addresses obtained from the public network.

* The provided scripts that enable Fuel
  to be automatically installed on VirtualBox
  create separate host interfaces.
  If a user associates logical networks
  with different physical interfaces on different nodes,
  it causes network connectivity issues between OpenStack components.
  Please check to see if this has happened prior to deployment
  by clicking on the “Verify Networks” button on the Networks tab.

* The Fuel Master node services (such as PostgrSQL and RabbitMQ)
  are not restricted by a firewall.
  The Fuel Master node should live in a restricted L2 network
  so this should not create a security vulnerability.

* We could improve performance significantly by upgrading
  to a later version of the CentOS distribution
  (using the 3.10 kernel or later).
  See `LP1322641 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1322641>`_.

* Docker loads images very slowly on the Fuel Master node.
  See `LP1333458 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1333458>`_.
