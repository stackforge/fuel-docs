OpenStack Fuel
--------------

Known Issues
++++++++++++

* The Fuel library uses `centos-versions.yaml` and `ubuntu-versions.yaml`
  to look up package versions when running the puppet. To add a
  controller node the puppet is run on all controllers not just a
  new one. When puppet encounters a package of a different version
  in `centos/ubuntu-versions.yaml`, it tries to reinstall it.
  In case of Maintenance Updates this leads to a failed deployment.
  See `LP1470650 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1470650>`_.

Resolved Issues
+++++++++++++++

* The OCF scripts update procedure by RPM/DEB packages is introduced.
  See `LP1465771 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1465771>`_.
  However, there is no class for this package in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0.
  But you can install it manually.

  For Ubuntu::

   apt-get install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  For CentOS::

   yum install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  Run the above commands on all the cluster servers.
