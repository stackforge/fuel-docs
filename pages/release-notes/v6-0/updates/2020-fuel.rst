OpenStack Fuel
--------------

Known Issues
++++++++++++

* The Fuel library uses `centos-versions.yaml` and
  `ubuntu-versions.yaml` to look up package versions when running the
  puppet. To add a controller node, the puppet runs on all controllers
  not just on a new one. When puppet encounters a package of a
  different version in `centos/ubuntu-versions.yaml`, it tries to
  reinstall it. In case of Maintenance Updates this leads to a failed
  deployment. See `LP1470650`_.

  Workaround:

  #. Remove `centos/ubuntu-versions.yaml` from `/etc/puppet/manifests`::

       mv /etc/puppet/manifests/*.yaml ~/

Resolved Issues
+++++++++++++++

* Now OCF scripts can be updated by RPM/DEB packages. See `LP1465771`_.
  However, the package ``fuel-ha-utils6.0`` is not included into
  Mirantis OpenStack 6.0. Therefore, you can install it manually when
  applying updates for the first time:

  For Ubuntu::

   apt-get install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  For CentOS::

   yum install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  Run the above commands on all the cluster servers.
