Resolved Issues
+++++++++++++++

* Now OCF scripts can be updated by RPM/DEB packages. See `LP1465771`_.
  However, the package ``fuel-ha-utils6.0`` is not included into
  Mirantis OpenStack 6.0. Therefore, you can install it manually when
  applying updates for the first time:

  For Ubuntu::

   apt-get install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  For CentOS::

   yum install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  Run the above commands on all the cluster servers.

* RabbitMQ expiration policies were added to the OCF script to fix
  the issue with growing number of RabbitMQ queues during unexpected
  shutdown of controllers. See `LP1429124`_.
