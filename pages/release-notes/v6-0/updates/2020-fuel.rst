OpenStack Fuel
--------------

Resolved Issues
+++++++++++++++

* The OCF scripts update procedure by RPM/DEB packages is introduced.
  See `LP1465771`_.
  However, there is no class for this package in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0.
  But you can install it manually.

  For Ubuntu::

   apt-get install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  For CentOS::

   yum install fuel-ha-utils6.0

  Run the above commands on all the cluster servers.

* The Fuel library uses ``centos-versions.yaml`` and
  ``ubuntu-versions.yaml`` to look up package versions when running
  the puppet. To add a controller node, the puppet runs on all
  controllers, not just on a new one. When puppet encounters a package
  of a different version in ``centos/ubuntu-versions.yaml``, it tries
  to reinstall it. In case of Maintenance Updates this leads to a
  failed deployment. The fix removes the module of the package for
  MOS 6.0. See `LP1470650`_.

* RabbitMQ expiration policies were added to the OCF script to fix
  the issue with growing number of RabbitMQ queues during unexpected
  shutdown of controllers. See `LP1429124`_.
