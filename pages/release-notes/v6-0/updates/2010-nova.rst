OpenStack Compute (Nova)
------------------------

Resolved Issues
+++++++++++++++

* CVE-2015-0259 vulnerability has been fixed in the Nova console websocket.
  By tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious URL, a remote
  attacker was able to trigger a cross-site-websocket-hijacking vulnerability
  resulting in a potential hijack of consoles where a user was still logged in.
  See `LP1420273 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1420273>`_.

* Previously, when RabbitMQ failed, a consumer had been disconnected
  before a publisher sent a message. Currently, if the consumer has not
  declared a queue, the publisher does not send a message to an exchange
  that is not bound to a queue to prevent a message loss. Setting
  ``passive = True`` does not cause a publisher failure anymore,
  and it retries if a consumer has not declared the receiving queue yet.
  See `LP1427892 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1427892>`_.

* The issue of noVNC access to VMs when reverse DNS lookups fail has been fixed.
  See `LP1409661 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1409661>`_.

* The IPAddress object is transformed to string to address the
  `LP1435712 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/mos/+bug/1435712>`_ issue.
  If a user specifies an IP address using the :option:`--nic` option while booting
  an instance with the :command:`nova boot` command, a Compute node invokes
  the neutron client to create a port. However, as the IP address parameter used to
  be an IPAddress object, the neutron client failed to send the request to the neutron
  server.
