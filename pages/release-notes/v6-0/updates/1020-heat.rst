OpenStack Orchestration (Heat)
------------------------------

Resolved Issues
+++++++++++++++

* While deleting the stacks, some of them could hang in the
  UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS or DELETE_IN_PROGRESS state. The fix changed the
  approach of the resource backup during the stack update. Now, to
  back up a stack, the resource definition is saved (if it is not
  present in the stack template yet). See `LP1446678`_.

* Sometimes, the ``heat-api`` process was in the hot spin state, it
  steadily consumed 85-95% of CPU and didnâ€™t accept the HTTP requests
  due to a bug in ``python-requests``. The issue has been fixed by
  updating the ``python-urllib`` and ``python-requests`` packages.
