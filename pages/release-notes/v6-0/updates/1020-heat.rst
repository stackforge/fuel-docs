OpenStack Orchestration (Heat)
------------------------------

Resolved Issues
+++++++++++++++

* While deleting the stacks, some of them could hang in the
  UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS or DELETE_IN_PROGRESS state. The fix allows
  saving the resource definitions of backup for the resources updated
  in-place. See `LP1446678`_.

* Sometimes, the ``heat-api`` process was in the hot spin state, it
  steadily consumed 85-95% of CPU and didnâ€™t accept the HTTP requests
  due to a bug in ``python-requests``. The issue has been fixed by
  updating the ``python-urllib`` and ``python-requests`` packages.
  See `LP1404983`_.

* The authentication process that requests a domain user token now
  provides ``user_id`` instead of username. Authentication
  with ``user_id`` is more reliable, as it works even when ``username``
  is truncated or modified in any other way before it is passed to
  Keystone. See `LP1481197`_.

* If evaluation period is shorter than the instance starting
  time and ``repeat_actions`` is set to True, extra instances are
  created even when the cooldown is long enough. The fix prevents
  the creation of undesirable extra instances. See `LP1474332`_.
