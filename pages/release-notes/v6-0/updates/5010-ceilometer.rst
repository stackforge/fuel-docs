OpenStack Telemetry (Ceilometer)
--------------------------------

Resolved Issues
+++++++++++++++

* The PyMongo is updated to 2.6.3 for CentOS-based installations and
  does not cause a memory leak anymore. See `LP1425603`_.

* The Telemetry messaging listener is changed from the eventlet
  ``notification_listener`` executor to the blocking one. It is done
  to avoid failures of the ceilometer-agent-notification instances
  after restart and connection to RabbitMQ (that previously had socket
  errors about handshake timeout in its logs). See `LP1393505`_.

* When the ``self.timings`` parameter is set to ``False``, each
  request's time is not recorded anymore, and therefore, it doesnâ€™t
  cause unexpected memory leak. See `LP1439278`_.

* Previously, python-ceilometerclient didn't support the
  ``os_endpoint_type`` option for the keystone authentication.
  The bug fix adds this support. See `LP1449649`_.

* Previously, during OpenStack deployment, ceilometer-api didn't
  respond to all the requests, because the CursorProxy object tried
  to get an undefined parameter and failed. The CursorProxy used to
  reconnect to the MongoDB during any request if a failure occurred.
  The ``getattr`` property in the CursorProxy object was fixed, and
  now ceilometer-api works correctly. See `LP1415955`_.
