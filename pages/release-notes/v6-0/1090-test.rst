Known Issues in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0
--------------------------------------

Network verification issues
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Network verification can fail if a node is offline
  because Astute runs network verification
  but Astute does not know which nodes are online.
  See `LP1318659 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1318659>`_.

* The network verification checker does not test OVS VLANs.
  See `LP1350623 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1350623>`_.

OSTF (Health Check) issues
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Platform OSTF tests fail with "HTTP unauthorized" error.
  See `LP1349408 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1349408>`_.

* OSTF provides wrong failure message for ping probes.
  See `LP1323433 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1323433>`_

* "Request image list" OSTF test fails for environment with 'error' status.
  See `LP1330458 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1330458>`_.

* After resetting the environment, OSTF test results from the last
  environment are still displayed.
  See `LP1338669 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1338669>`_.

* RabbitMQ OSTF test is limited.
  The OSTF test for RabbitMQ only checks rabbitmqctl cluster_status. See the related
  `RabbitMQ OSTF replication tests <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/ostf-rabbit-replication-tests>_`
  blueprint.
