OpenStack Compute (Nova)
------------------------

Resolved Issues in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0.1
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Users have a correct Nova hypervisor stats report retrieved via
  both CLI and Horizon now. It was misleading when a shared storage
  backend (Ceph) was used. The actual amount of space available or
  used was multiplied by the number of compute nodes. This did not
  affect booting of instances in any way but confused an operator
  seeing the resources usage report.
