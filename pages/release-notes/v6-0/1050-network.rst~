Networking issues
=================

New Features and Resolved Issues in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0
----------------------------------------------------------

* Neutron metadata agent no longer
  fails after primary controller is shut down.
  See `LP1371561 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1371561>`_.

* Neutron GRE is deployed successfully in CentOS;
  no timeout error occurs.
  See `LP1382529 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1382529>`_.

* Neutron metadata agent start in OCF is fixed;
  Neutron OVS process is run separately.
  See `LP1389299 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1389299>`_.

* In HAProxy, Neutron API interface now has no nodes in backup mode.
  See `LP1276762 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1276762>`_.

* A router or a network is no longer
  created before administrator's tenant is.
  See `LP1385491 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1385491>`_.

* When Neutron is deployed with GRE, traffic on instances is no
  longer slow. To workaround this issues manually,
  you need to apply to all Ethernet interfaces the following command:

::

    ethtool --offload eth0 gro off


  
See `LP1256289 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1256289>`_.

* Neutron qrouter now migrates after network on the primary controller is
  deleted. See `LP1371550 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1371550>`_.

* Neutron L3 agent no longer has a misconfiguration error.
  See `LP1372787 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1372787>`_.

Known Issues in 6.0
-------------------

* In Neutron GRE HA mode, network list
  can not be retrieved.
  See `LP1383265 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1383265>`_.
  or https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1370231

* The floating VLAN and public networks
  must use the same L2 network and L3 Subnet.
  These two networks are locked together
  and can only run via the same physical interface on the server.
  See the `Separate public and floating networks blueprint
  <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/separate-public-floating>`_
  for information about ongoing work to remove this restriction.

* The Fuel Master node services (such as PostgrSQL and RabbitMQ)
  are not restricted by a firewall.
  The Fuel Master node should live in a restricted L2 network
  so this should not create a security vulnerability.

* L3 agent takes more than 30 seconds
  to failover to a standby controller
  when a controller node fails.
  See `LP1328970 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1328970>`_.

* Some OpenStack services listen to all of the interfaces,
  a situation that may be detected and reported
  by third-party scanning tools not provided by Mirantis.
  Please discuss this issue with your security administrator
  if it is a concern for your organization.

* A spurious "Critical error" is logged
  in the *neutron-openvswitch-agent.log* on the Compute node.
  It does not affect the behavior of Neutron networking
  and can be ignored.
  This is related to the upstream
  `LP1246848 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1246848>`_.

* Virtualbox scripts do not use NAT-network for a Public vboxnet.
  See `LP1275774 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1275774>`_.

* After rollback, Neutron server goes down on all controllers with failed
  OSTF tests.
  See `LP1364465 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1364465>`_.
