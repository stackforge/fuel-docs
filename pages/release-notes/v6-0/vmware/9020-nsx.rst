VMware NSX integration
----------------------

Known limitations in 5.1
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The VMware NSX integration into Mirantis OpenStack 5.1 is supported,
but it has some known limitations:


* Deployment interruption (stoppage or reset) by end user or errors during
  deployment leave NSX cluster in half configured state.  User has to manually
  remove all network logical entities that were created during the unsuccessful
  deployment; otherwise, the next deployment will fail due to inability to
  register OpenvSwitches in NSX and 'br-int' bridges on nodes would not be
  configured properly, because older ones with same names exist in NSX cluster.

* If the NSX cluster resides in a separate network that has L3 connectivity with
  the OpenStack Public network, you must enable Public address assignment for all
  nodes, see :ref:`neutron-nsx-arch`.

* In HA mode on NSX machine, OpenStack deployment crashes due to unavailable Neutron and Keystone services.
  See `LP1369529 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1369529>`_.

* When there are no NSX settings, Fuel UI allows clicking "Deploy changes".
  Make sure that you have specified NSX settings.
