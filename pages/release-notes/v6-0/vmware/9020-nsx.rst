VMware NSX integration
----------------------
New Features and Resolved Issues in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* In HA mode on NSX machine, OpenStack deployment no longer crashes due to
  unavailable Neutron and Keystone services.
  See `LP1369529 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1369529>`_.

* vCenter as a Hypervisor and NSX as a networking option are now enabled in Fuel.
  Fuel 5.0 had a limited support of vCenter as a hypervisor and no NSX support at all,
  but OpenStack can be integrated with both these components.
  See `vCenter NSX support <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/vcenter-nsx-support>`_.

Known limitations in 6.0
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The VMware NSX integration into Mirantis OpenStack 5.1 is supported,
but it has some known limitations:

* Deployment interruption (stoppage or reset) by end user or errors during
  deployment leave NSX cluster in half configured state.  User has to manually
  remove all network logical entities that were created during the unsuccessful
  deployment; otherwise, the next deployment will fail due to inability to
  register OpenvSwitches in NSX and 'br-int' bridges on nodes would not be
  configured properly, because older ones with same names exist in NSX cluster.

* If the NSX cluster resides in a separate network that has L3 connectivity with
  the OpenStack Public network, you must enable Public address assignment for all
  nodes, see :ref:`neutron-nsx-arch`.

* When there are no NSX settings, Fuel UI allows clicking "Deploy changes".
  Make sure that you have specified NSX settings.
  See `LP1347682 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1347682>`_.

* Old transport nodes in NSX are not automatically removed prior to     installation. See `LP1370775 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1370775>`_.

* RabbitMQ hosts must be updated on non-controller nodes after controllers are deployed.
  See `LP1368445 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1368445>`_.
