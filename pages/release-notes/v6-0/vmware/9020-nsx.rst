VMware NSX integration
----------------------

.. warning:: VMware NSX support in Fuel 6.0 is available only in Experimental mode.
   To enable it, see :ref:`experimental-features-op` .

New Features and Resolved Issues in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* In HA mode with NSX enabled, OpenStack deployment no longer crashes due to
  unavailable Neutron and Keystone services.
  See `LP1369529 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1369529>`_.

* vCenter supports NSX as an experimental feature.
  See
  `vCenter NSX support <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/fuel/+spec/vcenter-nsx-support>`_.

* Support of **non-Service node** mode is now enabled for NSX.
  See `LP1365043 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1365043>`_ and
  :ref:`nsx-plan`.

Known limitations in 6.0
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The VMware NSX integration into Mirantis OpenStack 6.0 is supported,
but it has some known limitations:

* Instances failed to get an IP Address on Ubuntu + NSX deployment.
  This happens, because NSX bits may be incompatible with Ubuntu packages and kernel
  versions. To work around this problem, you should install a newer
  version of NSX bits package.
  See `LP1371607 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1371607>`_.

* Deployment interruption (stoppage or reset) by end user or errors during
  deployment leave NSX cluster in half configured state.  User has to manually
  remove all network logical entities that were created during the unsuccessful
  deployment; otherwise, the next deployment will fail due to inability to
  register OpenvSwitches in NSX and 'br-int' bridges on nodes would not be
  configured properly, because older ones with same names exist in NSX cluster.

* If the NSX cluster resides in a separate network that has L3 connectivity with
  the OpenStack Public network, you must enable Public address assignment for all
  nodes, see :ref:`neutron-nsx-arch`.

* When there are no NSX settings, Fuel UI allows clicking "Deploy changes".
  Make sure that you have specified correct NSX settings.
  See `LP1347682 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1347682>`_.

* When deploying environment with enabled NSX plugin, several problems may occur:
  for instance, if Neutron configuration did not succeed, Fuel marks this deployment
  as a successful one.
  Error messages in Puppet logs may indicate this problem.
  One more failure may take place when you try to redeploy your environment with NSX.
  In this case, before redeploying you should delete all OpenStack-related nodes
  that have already been registered. See `LP1373403 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1373403>`_,
  `LP1370775 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1370775>`_,
  and `LP1373445 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1373445>`_.
