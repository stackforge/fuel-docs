Preparing for vSphere Integration
=================================
Fuel 5.0 and later can deploy a Mirantis OpenStack environment
that boots and manages virtual machines in VMware vSphere.
VMware provides a vCenter driver for OpenStack
that enables the Nova-compute service to
communicate with a VMware vCenter server
that manages one or more ESX host clusters.
The vCenter driver makes management convenient
from both the OpenStack Dashboard (:ref:`horizon-term`)
and from vCenter,
where advanced vSphere features can be accessed.

This section summarizes the planning you should do
and other steps that are required
before you attempt to deploy Mirantis OpenStack
with vCenter intergration.

For more information:

- See :ref:`vcenter-arch` for information about how vCenter support
  is implemented in Mirantis OpenStack;

- :ref:`vcenter-deploy` gives instructions for creating and deploying
  a Mirantis OpenStack environment that is integrated with VMware vSphere.

- For background information about VMware vSphere support in OpenStack,
  see the `VMware vSphere - OpenStack Manuals
  <http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/config-reference/content/vmware.html>`_.

- The official vSphere installation guide can be found here:
  `vSphere Installation and Setup

vSphere Installation
--------------------
Before installing Fuel and using it
to create a Mirantis OpenStack environment
that is integrated with VMware vSphere,
the vSphere installation must be up and running.
Please check that you completed the following steps:

* Install vSphere
* Install vCenter
* Install ESXi
* Configure vCenter

	* Create DataCenter
	* Create vCenter cluster
	* Add ESXi host(s)

ESXi Host Networks Configuration
--------------------------------
The ESXi host(s) network must be configured appropriately
in order to enable intergration of Mirantis OpenStack with vCenter.
Follow the steps below:

1. Open the ESXi host page,
   select the "Manage" tab and click on "Networking".
   vSwitch0 and all its networks are shown.
   Click the Add Network button:

2. In the "Add Networking" wizard, select the Virtual Machine Port group:

   PageBreak

3. On the next page, select the "Virtual Machine Port Group" option
   to ensure that the network will be created in vSwitch0:

4. Always name the network **br100**;
   this is the only value that works with Fuel;
   type a VLAN Tag in the VLAN ID field;
   (the value must be equal to the VLAN Tag at *VM Fixed*
   on Fuelâ€™s :ref:`network-settings-vcenter-ug` tab):

Limitations
------------------------------
- Only :ref:`nova-network-term` with flatDHCP mode is supported
  in the current version of the integration.
- OpenStack Block Storage service (Cinder)
  with VMware VMDK datastore driver is not supported;
  you can only use Cinder with the LVM over iSCSI option
  as the Cinder backend.
- Each OpenStack environment can support one vCenter cluster.
- VMware vCenter can be deployed on Mirantis OpenStack
  with or without high-availability (HA) configured.
  Note, however, that the vCenter Nova plugin
  runs on only one Controller node,
  even if that Controller node is replicated to provide HA.
  See `LP1312653 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1312653>`_.

For background information about how vCenter support
is integrated into Mirantis OpenStack, see :ref:`vcenter-arch`.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`vcenter-deploy`
to deploy your Mirantis OpenStack environment with vCenter support.
