mySQL
------

  See `Preparing MySQL for Pacemaker high availability` <http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-ops/content/security_groups.html`_.

Nailgun server
--------------
Fuel uses nailgun for ??

Note that this is not the Nailgun that provides
a JVM in which Java programs can be run without incurring
the standard JVM startup overhead. 
See the `Nailgun web page <http://www.martiansoftware.com/nailgun/>`_
for more information.

Neutron
-------
OpenStack Core project to provide networking as a service
between interface devices such as vNICS
that are managed by other OpenStack services such as Nova.
See the `Neutron web page <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron>`_
for more information.

Mirantis OpenStack includes Neutron;
see `Neutron Deployment <http://docs.mirantis.com/fuel/fuel-4.0/pre-install-guide.html#neutron>`_
for a description of the recommended network configuration parameters
for using the Neutron service.

NIC
---
Network Interface Card (physical Ethernet port)

Nova
----
OpenStack Core project used for compute nodes;
all major Nova components can be run on multiple servers
and use message queues for communication between components.
See the `Nova web page <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/>`_
for more information.

Mirantis OpenStack includes the Nova-network deployment model
which offers the FlatDHCPManager and VLAN Manager options
for deploying private networks for tenants;
see `Nova-network Deployment Model` <http://docs.mirantis.com/fuel/fuel-4.0/pre-install-guide.html#nova-network>`_
for more information about using Nova-network in Mirantis OpenStack.

has recently been forked into its own project; see "Ironic".

Object Storage technology
-------------------------
Provides a fully distributed, API-accessible storage platform
that can be integraed directly into applications
or used for backup, archiving, and data retention.
This is not a traditional file system
but rather a distributed storage system for static data
such as virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage,
backups, and archives.
Objects and files are written to multiple disk drives
spread across different servers in the data center;
the OpenStack software ensures data replication and integrity
across the cluster.

OpenStack
---------

to deliver a massively scalable cloud operating system
that can be used for private and public clouds.
For more information, see the

The Mirantis OpenStack distribution packages
a stable version of the open source pieces
into an installable package that deploys an operating system 
based on either Ubuntu or CentOS.
and adds Fuel to simplify the deployment and management tasks.
Fuel can also manage the Red Hat OpenStack distribution
that deploys the Red Hat Operating System on the OpenStack nodes.
