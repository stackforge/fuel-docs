Configuring Fuel Using the ISO image
====================================

Mirantis provides the Fuel ISO image that is easy to install on a virtual machine
or physical hardware.

To install Fuel using the ISO image:

#. Download the Fuel ISO from the `Mirantis web-site <http://software.mirantis.com/>`_.

#. Mount or burn the ISO.

#. Power on your machine.
   The Fuel boot menu appears.

#. Optionally, configure the IP address, default gateway, and DNS server by
   pressing TAB.

#. Optionally, set the ``showmenu`` property to **Yes** to open the extended
   network configuration menu during installation.

When Fuel is installed,
you can follow the instructions in :ref:`deploy-environment-ug`
to deploy a new Mirantis OpenStack environment.
