Preparing the Mirantis OpenStack Deployment
===========================================

Before installation, plan your deployment. Determine the deployment type that
is appropriate for you configuration needs. You may want to print this
list and make notes indicating your selection so you can be sure
you have planned your deployment correctly.

The following table provides a list of configuration steps that you must
complete to plan the Mirantis OpenStack deployment.

| 1  | Consider which deployment  | For more information, see:                |
|    | mode you will deploy       | :ref:`Reference Architecture <ref-arch>`. |
|    | (Multi-node HA or non HA)  |                                           |
+----+----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+
| 2  | Select a network service   | For more information, see:                |

| 5  | Prepare an addressing plan | Identify the network addresses and VLAN   |
|    | and network association.   | IDs for your Public, floating, Management,|
