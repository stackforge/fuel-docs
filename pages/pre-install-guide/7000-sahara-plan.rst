Planning a Sahara Deployment
============================

When deploying an OpenStack Environment
that includes Sahara for running Hadoop
you need to consider a few special conditions.

**Floating IPs**

Fuel configures Sahara to use floating IPs to manage the VMs.
This means that you must provide a Floating IP pool
in each Node Group Template you define.

A special case is if you are using Nova-Network
and you have set the **auto_assign_floating_ip** parameter to true
by checking the appropriate box on the Fuel UI.
In this case, a floating IP is automatically assigned to each VM
and the "floating ip pool" dropdown menu
is hidden in the OpenStack Dashboard.

In either case, Sahara assigns a floating IP to each VM it spawns
so be sure to allocate enough floating IPs.

**Security Groups**

Sahara does not configure OpenStack Security Groups
so you must manually configure the default security group
in each tenant where Sahara will be used.
See :ref:`sahara-ports` for a list of ports that need to be opened.

**VM Flavor Requirements**

Hadoop requires at least 1G of memory to run.
That means you must use flavors that have
at least 1G of memory for Hadoop cluster nodes.

**Communication between virtual machines**

Be sure that communication between virtual machines is not blocked.
