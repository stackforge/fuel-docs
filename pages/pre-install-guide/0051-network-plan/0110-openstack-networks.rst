Networks used by OpenStack
--------------------------

The OpenStack architecture defines a set of
logical networks that are used in the OpenStack environment;
see :ref:`logical-networks-arch`.

Your network plan must define how these logical networks
will be mapped to the physical NICs in your data center.
You will define this mapping in Fuel
before your environment is deployed.
