Routing recommendations
-----------------------

Consider the following routing recommendations when you configure your
network:

-  Use the default routing via a router in the Public network
-  Use the the management network to access to your management
   infrastructure (L3 connectivity if necessary)
-  The Storage and VM networks should be configured without access to
   other networks (no L3 connectivity)
