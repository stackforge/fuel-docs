Preparing for vSphere Integration
=================================
OpenStack Compute supports the VMware vSphere product family. The VMware vCenter driver enables the nova-compute service to communicate with a VMware vCenter server that manages one or more ESX host clusters.

For background information about VMware vSphere support in OpenStack, see `VMware vSphere - OpenStack Manuals <http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/config-reference/content/vmware.html>`_.

This section summarizes the planning you should do
and other steps that are required
before you attempt to deploy Mirantis OpenStack
with vCenter intergration.

vSphere Installation
--------------------
The vSphere installation must be up and running.

The official vSphere installation guide can be found here:
  `vSphere Installation and Setup <http://pubs.vmware.com/vsphere-55/index.jsp#com.vmware.vsphere.install.doc/GUID-7C9A1E23-7FCD-4295-9CB1-C932F2423C63.html>`_.

Please check that you completed the following steps:
* Install vSphere
* Install vCenter
* Install ESXi 
* Configure vCenter

	* Create DataCenter is created 
	* Create vCenter cluster
	* Add ESXi host(s)

ESXi Host Networks Configuration
--------------------------------
In order to enable intergration of Mirantis OpenStack with vCenter the ESXi host(s) networks must be configured in a certain way.
Follow the steps below:

1. Open ESXi host page, select Manage tab and click Networking. vSwitch0 and all it’s networks will be shown. Click Add Network button:

2. In Add networking wizard select Virtual Machine Port group:

3. On next page make sure network will be created in vSwitch0:

4. Always name network as **br100** (only this value works with FUEL) and type a VLAN Tag in VLAN ID field (the value must be equal to VLAN Tag at *VM Fixed* on FUEL’s Networks tab):

Limitations
------------------------------
- Only :ref:`nova-network-term` with flatDHCP mode is supported in the current version of the integration. 
- OpenStack Block Storage service (Cinder) with VMware VMDK datastore driver is not supported.
- 1 vCenter cluster per OpenStack cloud.
- VMware vCenter can be deployed on Mirantis OpenStack with or without high-availability (HA) configured. Note, however, that the vCenter Nova plugin runs on only one Controller node, even if that Controller node is replicated to provide HA.

For background information about how vCenter support is integrated into Mirantis OpenStack, see :ref:`vcenter-arch`.

Follow the instructions in :ref:`vcenter-deploy` to deploy your Mirantis OpenStack environment with vCenter support.
