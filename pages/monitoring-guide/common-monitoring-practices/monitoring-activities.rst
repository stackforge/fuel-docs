Monitoring Activities
---------------------

As stated earlier, this document is not prescriptive of a particular
monitoring system or solution. Instead, it strives to describe common
monitoring practices with problem domains and activities to address them
that are key to get clear operational insights in order to take actions
when problems occur. In this chapter, we try to describe what those
activities are as clearly as possible.
