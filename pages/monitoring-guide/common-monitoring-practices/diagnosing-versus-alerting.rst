Diagnosing versus Alerting
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The operational data gathering, that results from the common
monitoring practices described above, should serve two different
purposes that should not be confused. One is to identify the root
cause of a problem. Hereafter, this is referred to as diagnosing.
The other one is to send real-time notifications to the operator
when something is broken that needs to be repaired. Hereafter, this
is referred to as alerting. But those **alerts** have to be smart.
As stated multiple times it is pointless and ineffective to flood
the operator with alerts that are not reflective of a situation that
requires the operatorâ€™s attention whether it is immediate or
deferred.
