Swift
-----

Swift is the OpenStack project, which provides highly available, distributed
and eventually consistent storage services for objects. It is used by default
as a storage backend to store Glance images.

**API Checks**

Check the availability of the service through synthetic HTTP transactions
against the Swift API endpoint:

* create a container
* upload a small (few kilobytes) object
* delete the container and object


**Collected Metrics**

The Swift project is made to collect metrics natively. Indeed, it is the only
OpenStack project that is natively instrumented to send metrics to `statsd`_ or
any statsd enabled data acquisition service like `Heka`_. It provides real-time
operational data about the object storage cluster activity and errors across
all components. Please check the documentation for further information about
how to enable statsd metrics in the `Swift developer documentation`_.
