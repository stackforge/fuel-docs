Intended Audience
=================

The primary audience of this document are the architects and technical staff
involved in the design and deployment of an OpenStack cloud. The other
audiences are the members of the operations staff that are in charge of managing
and maintaining the OpenStack cloud in a healthy state on a daily basis.
This includes:

Line of Business Owner
  The Line of Business Owner needs to know how "things" are running and if there
  are any problems that may affect the SLA. This person focuses on marketing and
  business, not IT, and, thus, is interested in top level indicators to know about
  services health.

Operational support
  Provides support to customers encountering issues. Is generally organized with a
  service desk and two support levels for problem escalation. The support relies on
  monitoring solutions to perform diagnostics and also should benefit from preventive
  alerts.

Subject Matter Expert
  Investigates and resolves a domain-specific problem. Validates the resolution.
  Uses the monitoring system to troubleshoot and observe the cloud infrastructure
  behaviour.
