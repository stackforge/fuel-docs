Murano
------

Murano is an OpenStack service which provides a catalog of
applications that can be readily deployed in an OpenStack cloud.
Murano orchestrates the deployment of those applications
automatically using other OpenStack services.

.. _neutron:

In MOS 7.0, Neutron will be an optional dependency. If not found in
Keystone, Murano will fall back to use Nova Network.

.. _amqp:

May be configured to use an additional instance of RabbitMQ. Note
that the RabbitMQ instance used by Murano resides on the primary
controller node and listens on port 55572 on the public network.


| **API checks**

Check the proper functioning of the API with a read operation. For
example:

* list available packages:

  /v1/catalog/packages

* check if the package with Core Murano library is registered:

  /v1/catalog/packages?fqn=io.murano

  This API call should return a JSON object with “packages” property
  set to a json-array containing at least one object.

| **Collected Metrics**

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 20
   :stub-columns: 0
   :class: borderless

   * - Metrics
     - Source
     - Purpose

   * - API errors
     - Logs or HAProxy:

       All HTTP 500 error code.
     - Alert:

       When a sudden spike of errors is detected.

   * - Number of environments
     - Poll SQL:

       select count(id) from environment;
     - diag

   * - Number of successful deployments
     - Poll SQL:

       select count(id) from session where state='deployed'
     - diag

   * - Number of running deployments
     - Poll SQL:

       select count(id) from session where state='deploying'
     - diag

   * - Number of deployments which failed to complete or failed to be deleted
     - Poll SQL:

       select count(id) from session where state like '%failure'
     - diag

   * - Number of running deployments which have not been updated for
       more than 2 hours
     - Poll SQL:

       select count(id) from session where state='deploying' and
       updated < (now() - INTERVAL 2 HOUR)
     - Alert:

       Deployment in ``deploying`` state which has not been updated
       for a long period of time likely indicates a job which has
       hung up and needs some attention.

   * - Total number of application packages in catalog
     - Poll SQL:

       select count(id) from package;
     - diag


Murano RabbitMQ instance
++++++++++++++++++++++++

| **Process checks:**

Murano RabbitMQ instance runs as a named instance -
``murano@localhost``.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 20 20 20
   :stub-columns: 0
   :class: borderless

   * - Process name
     - Incoming connections
     - Role
     - HA mode

   * - beam
     - TCP 41056, 55572
     - controller
     - no

The command below returns the status of the Murano RabbitMQ instance::

 # rabbitmqctl -n murano@localhost status

And the following command returns the pid of the Murano RabbitMQ
instance if it exists::

 # ps axf | grep beam | grep  'murano@localhost' | grep -oP '(?<=(^\s))(\d+)'
