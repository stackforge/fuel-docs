Installing Mirantis OpenStack Using Scripts
-------------------------------------------

The Mirantis VirtualBox scripts significantly simplify deployment of
the OpenStack environment. The scripts install the Fuel Master node
and Fuel Slave nodes, which create a platform for the OpenStack
components. You can install Mirantis OpenStack using the automated
scripts on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, or Linux.

If you are installing Mirantis OpenStack on Microsoft Windows,
verify the following:

* Virtualization is enabled in BIOS
* You completed the steps described in :ref:`qs_scripts_run_windows`.

**Procedure:**

1. On your computer, extract the Mirantis VirtualBox scripts in a
   directory.
2. Copy the Mirantis OpenStack ISO image to the iso folder.
3. Run the ``launch.sh``, ``launch_8GB``, or ``launch_16GB script``.

   * If you use Microsoft Windows:

     1. Run Cygwin.
     2. In the Cygwin prompt, navigate to the directory where you
        extracted the ``launch.sh`` file.

        **Example:**

        ::

          cd /cygdrive/c/Users/{name}/Desktop/virtualbox

     3. Run the ``launch.sh``, ``launch_8GB``, or ``launch_16GB``
        script in Cygwin.

        **Example:**

        ::

          sh launch.sh

        The script installs the Fuel Master node on VirtualBox.
        The installation may take up to 30 minutes. Do not turn
        off your computer or interrupt the installation.

     4. Proceed to :ref:`start-create-env-ug`.
