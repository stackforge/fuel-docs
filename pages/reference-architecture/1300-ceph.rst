How Fuel deploys Ceph
=====================

Fuel uses Puppet manifests
and [what else?]
to configure, provision, and deploy a Ceph cluster
in the OpenStack environment.
Fuel also ensures that other OpenStack components
are aware that Ceph storage is configured.

Mirantis OpenStack 4.0 and later
includes enhancements to the Ceph copy-on-write capability
that are not included in the vanilla OpenStack Havana and Icehouse releases:

 * It is not necessary to create an RBD backed bootable volume
   from a raw image for copy-on-write and live migrations to work
   on Mirantis OpenStack.

 * Launching an image on Mirantis OpenStack
   results in a copy-on-write clone in Ceph,
   whereas it results in a full copy on the Compute node
   for vanilla OpenStack deployments.

 * Ceph on Mirantis OpenStack stores :ref:`ephemeral drives <ephemeral-term>`
   so that Live Migration is supported for instances
   that use ephemeral drives.
   Vanilla OpenStack deployments can only store ephemeral drives
   in local files on a Compute node.
