Ceph RBD storage
----------------

The OpenStack Ceph cluster consists of:

- A small number of Ceph Mon (monitor) daemons
  that run on the OpenStack controller node.
- Two or more Ceph OSD (Object Storage Device) nodes
  that store the actual data in :ref:`rados` format.
  Ideally, each of these runs on a dedicated node
  but they can be run on a Compute node.
- :ref:`glance` serves as the Ceph client.

For more details about Ceph and RADOS,
including capabilities you can configure manually
after deploying your OpenStack environment with Fuel,
see the references in the :ref:`ceph-term` and :ref:`rados` articles.
