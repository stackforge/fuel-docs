Neutron VLAN Segmentation Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on the number of NICs you have in your node servers,
you can use the following examples to plan your NIC assignment
to the OpenStack :ref:`logical-networks-arch`.
Note that you must have at least three NICS configured
to use the Neutron VLAN topology.

3 NIC deployment

-  eth0 - untagged port for Administrative network
-  eth1 (br-eth1) - port for networks: Public/Floating, Management,
   Storage
-  eth2 (br-eth2) - port for Private network (where the number of VLANs
   depends on the number of tenant networks with a continuous range)

4 NIC deployment

-  eth0 - port for Administrative network
-  eth1 (br-eth1) - port for networks: Public/Floating, Management
-  eth2 (br-eth2) - port for Private network, with defined VLAN range
   IDs
-  eth3 (br-eth1) - port for Storage network

Routing recommendations

-  Use the default routing via a router in the Public network
-  Use the the management network to access to your management
   infrastructure (L3 connectivity if necessary)
-  The administrative network or only the Fuel server (via dedicated
   NIC) should have Internet access
-  The Storage and Private network (VLANs) should be configured without
   access to other networks (no L3 connectivity)

Neutron GRE Segmentation Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depdnding on the number of NICs you have in your node servers, you can use the
foldowing examples to plan your NIC assignment:

-  eth0 - untagged port for Administrative network
-  eth1 (br-eth1) - port for networks: Public/Floating, Management,
   Storage
