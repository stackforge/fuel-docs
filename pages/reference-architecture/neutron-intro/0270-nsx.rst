Neutron with VMware NSX
-----------------------

A typical network configuration for Neutron with VMware NSX
might look like this, it is assumed that the NSX nodes have L2 connectivity
with OpenStack nodes:

If your NSX cluster resides in its own network and you do not want to relocate
you NSX nodes, it is possible to use L3 connectivity between the NSX network
and the OpenStack Public network. In order to achive this setup you must enable
Public network addresses assignment to all nodes by checking this box on the
Settings tab:

Here is an example of how it will look:

.. note:: You do not need a physically separate Private network for this
          setup.
