Logical Networks
================

.. contents :local:

For better network performance and manageability,
Fuel places different types of traffic into separate logical networks.
his section describes how to distribute
the network traffic in an OpenStack cluster.

.. index:: Admin (PXE) Network

Admin (PXE) Network ("Fuel network")

  The Fuel Master Node uses this network
  to provision and orchestrate the OpenStack environment.
  It is used during installation to provide DNS, DHCP, and gateway services
  to a node before that node is provisioned.
  Nodes retrieve their network configuration
  from the Fuel Master node using DHCP,
  which is why this network must be isolated from the rest of your network
  and must not have a DHCP server other than the Fuel Master running on it.


.. index:: Public Network

Public Network

  For security reasons, the public network is usually isolated
  from other networks in the cluster.
  The word "Public" means that these addresses can be used
  to communicate with the cluster and its VMs from outside of the cluster
  (the Internet, corporate network, end users).

  The public network also provides connectivity to
  the globally routed address space for VMs.
  The IP address from the public network
  that has been assigned to a compute node
  is used as the source for the Source NAT performed
  for traffic going from VM instances on the compute node to the Internet.

  The public network also provides Virtual IPs for Endpoint nodes,
  which are used to connect to OpenStack services APIs.

  A Floating network IP address can be assigned to a single VM.

  The public network provides the address space for the floating IPs
  that are assigned to individual VM instances
  by the project administrator.
  Nova Network or Neutron services can then configure
  this address on the public network interface
  of the Network controller node.
  Environments based on Nova Network use iptables
  to create a Destination NAT from this address
  to the private IP of the corresponding VM instance
  through the appropriate virtual bridge interface
  on the Network controller node.

Internal Network

  The internal network connects all OpenStack nodes in the environment.
  All components of an OpenStack environment
  communicate with each other using this network.
  This network must be isolated from both the private and public networks
  for security reasons.

  The internal network can also be used for serving iSCSI protocol exchanges
  between Compute and Storage nodes.

Storage Network

  Part of a cluster's internal network.
  It is used to separate storage traffic
  (Swift, Ceph, iSCSI, etc.)
  from other types of internal communications in the cluster.

Management network

  Also part of a cluster's internal network.
  It serves all other internal communications,
  including database queries, AMQP messaging, high availability services).

Private Network (Fixed network)

  The private network facilitates communication between each tenant's VMs.
  Private network address spaces
  are not a part of the enterprise network address space;
  fixed IPs of virtual instances cannot be accessed directly
  from the rest of Enterprise network.
