API

If you want to change or add some tasks right on
the Fuel Master node, just add the ``tasks.yaml`` file
and respective manifests in the folder for the release that you are interested in.
Then run the following command:

::

       fuel rel --sync-deployment-tasks --dir /etc/puppet

If you want to overwrite the deployment tasks for any specific
release/cluster, use the following commands:

::

       fuel rel --rel <id> --deployment-tasks --download
       fuel rel --rel <id> --deployment-tasks --upload

       fuel env --env <id> --deployment-tasks --download
       fuel env --env <id> --deployment-tasks --upload


After this is done, you will be able to run a customized graph of tasks.
To do that, use a basic command:

::

      fuel node --node <1>,<2>,<3> --tasks upload_repos netconfig

The developer will need to specify nodes that should be used in deployment and
task IDs. The order in which these are provided does not matter.
It will be computed from the dependencies specified in the database.

.. note:: The node will not be executed, if a task is mapped to Controller role,
          but the node where you want to apply the task does not have this role.

Skipping tasks
--------------

Use the ``skip`` parameter to skip tasks:

::

       fuel node --node <1>,<2>,<3> --skip netconfig hiera

The list of tasks specified with the ``skip`` parameter will
be skipped during
graph traversal in Nailgun.

If there are task dependencies, you may want to make use of a "smarter" traversal
- you will need to
specify the start and end nodes in the graph:

::

       fuel node --node <1>,<2>,<3> --end netconfig


This will deploy everything up to the netconfig task, including it.
This means, that this commands will deploy all tasks
that are a part of ``pre_deployment``: keys generation, rsync
manifests, sync time, upload repos, including such tasks as hiera setup,
globals computation and maybe some other
basic preparatory tasks:

::

      fuel node --node <1>,<2>,<3> --start netconfig


Start from ``netconfig`` task (including it), deploy all the tasks that are
a part of ``post_deployment``.

For example, if you want to execute only the netconfig successors,
use:

::

       fuel node --node <1>,<2>,<3> --start netconfig --skip netconfig


You will also be able to use ``start`` and ``end`` at the same time:

::

       fuel node --node <1>,<2>,<3> --start netconfig --end upload_cirros


Nailgun will build a path that includes only necessary tasks to join these two
points.
