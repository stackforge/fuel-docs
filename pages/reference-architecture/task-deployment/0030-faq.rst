What can I use for deployment with groups?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can only use Puppet for the main deployment.

All agents, except for Puppet, work in a blocking way.
The current deployment model cannot execute some tasks
that are blocking and non-blocking.

In the ``pre_deployment`` and ``post_deployment`` stages,
any of the supported task drivers can be used.

Is it possible to specify cross-dependencies between groups?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Fuel 6.0 or earlier, there is no model that will allow to run tasks
on a primary Controller, then run on a Controller with getting back to
the primary Controller.

In Fuel 6.1 and newer, the cross-dependencies are resolved by the
``post_deployment`` stage.

How can I end at the provision state?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provision is not a part of task-based deployment.

How to stop deployment at the network configuration state?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Fuel CLI <cli_usage>` call can be used:
it will execute the deployment up to the network configuration
state:

::

  fuel node --node <1>,<2>,<3> --end netconfig
