What i can use for deployment during groups?
---------------------------------------------

In 6.1 it is possible to use only puppet for main deployment.

All agents except puppet are working in blocking way, and our deployment
model can not execute some tasks that are blocking and non blocking.
This is part of technical debt that can be easily resolved with mistral.

In pre/post deployment stages any of the supported task drivers can be used.

Is it possible to specify cross-dependencies between groups?
-------------------------------------------------------------

We can not provide a model right now that will allow to run some tasks
on primary-controller, than run on controller, and then get back to
primary-controller.

In 6.1 cross-dependencies will be solved by post deployment stage.

Cross dependency will be available when we will have orchestrator with
convenient graph based api, like mistral.

How i can end at provision state?
-------------------------------------

Provision is not a part of task based deployment in 6.1.
We will consider to merge it in the same graph in next releases.


How to stop deployment at network configuration?
-------------------------------------------------

CLI call can be used that will execute deployment up to network configuration
state.

  fuel node --node 1,2,3 --end netconfig
