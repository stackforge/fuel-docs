What can I use for deployment with groups?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Fuel 6.1, it is possible to use only Puppet for the main deployment.

All agents, except for Puppet, work in a blocking way. The current deployment
model cannot execute some tasks that are blocking and non-blocking.

In the ``pre_deployment`` and ``post_deployment`` stages,
any of the supported task drivers can be used.

Is it possible to specify cross-dependencies between groups?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In Fuel 6.0 or earlier, there is no model that will allow to run tasks
on a primary Controller, then run on a controlle with getting back to the
primary Controller.

In Fuel 6.1, cross-dependencies are resolved by the ``post_deployment`` stage.

How I can end at the provision state?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provision is not a part of task-based deployment in Fuel 6.1.

How to stop deployment at the network configuration state?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Fuel CLI <cli_usage>` call can be used:
it will execute the deployment up to the network configuration
state:

::

  fuel node --node <1>,<2>,<3> --end netconfig
