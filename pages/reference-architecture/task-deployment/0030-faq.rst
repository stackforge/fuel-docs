What can I use for deployment with groups?
------------------------------------------

In Fuel 6.1 it is possible to use only Puppet for the main deployment.

All agents, except for Puppet, work in a blocking way. Our deployment
model can not execute some tasks that are blocking and non-blocking.

In the *pre_deployment* and *post_deployment* stages
any of the supported task drivers can be used.

Is it possible to specify cross-dependencies between groups?
-------------------------------------------------------------

In Fuel 6.0 or older there is no model that will allow to run tasks
on a primary Controller, then run on a controller, and then get back to the
primary Controller.

In Fuel 6.1 cross-dependencies are resolved by the *post_deployment* stage.

How I can end at the provision state?
-------------------------------------

Provision is not a part of task based deployment in Fuel 6.1.

How to stop deployment at the network configuration state?
----------------------------------------------------------

CLI call can be used that will execute the deployment up to the network configuration
state.

  fuel node --node 1,2,3 --end netconfig
