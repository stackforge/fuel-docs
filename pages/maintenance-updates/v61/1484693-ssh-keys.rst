OpenSSH fills auth.log up due to missing ed25519 host key file
==============================================================

During the installation of OpenSSH, the `ssh-keygen` utility does not generate
all the needed host keys. Therefore, the `OpenSSH` process generates error messages
that overfill the ``auth.log`` file. See `LP1484693 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1484693>`_.

Affected packages
-----------------
* **CentOS/@6.1:** fuel-library6.1=6.1.0-6756.2

Fixed packages
--------------
* **CentOS/@6.1:** fuel-library6.1=6.1.0-6757.2

Patching scenario - Fuel Master node
------------------------------------

Run the following commands on the Fuel Master node::

        yum clean expire-cache
        yum -y update fuel-library

.. note:: After updating the fuel-library package on the Fuel Master node, only
   newly created environments are deployed with the fixed behavior of OpenSSH.
   In order to fix the existing environments, execute the commands below.

Patching scenario - Ubuntu
--------------------------

Run the following command on all the slave nodes to make sure all the possible keys are generated::

        ssh-keygen -A
