[logrotate] The sharedscripts option conflicts with delaycompress option
========================================================================

Currently, both ``delaycompress`` and ``sharedscripts`` options are enabled.
The first one causes logrotate to rename matching files and compresses them on
the next rotation, and the ``sharedscripts`` option executes the postrotate script
on all the affected files. However, the ``sharedscripts`` option precedes
the ``delaycompress`` option. Therefore, logrotate includes the renamed
uncompressed files to the rotation list and eventually fails due to
the filenames conflict which breaks the entire rotation. The fix deletes
``sharedscripts`` from the logrotate configuration files.
