Adding Slave Nodes Manually
---------------------------

Next, create Slave nodes where OpenStack needs to be installed.

1. Create 3 or 4 additional VMs
   with the following parameters:

* OS Type: Linux, Version: Ubuntu (64bit)
* RAM: 1536+ MB (2048+ MB recommended)
* HDD: 50+ GB, with dynamic disk expansion
* Network 1: host-only interface vboxnet0, PCnet-FAST III device

2. Set Network as first in the boot order:

.. image:: /_images/vbox-image1.jpg
  :align: center
  :width: 75%

3. Configure two or more network adapters on each VM (in order to use single network
   adapter for each VM you should choose "Use VLAN Tagging" later in the Fuel UI):

.. image:: /_images/vbox-image2.jpg
  :align: center
  :width: 75%

4. Open "advanced" collapse, and check following options:

* Set Promiscuous mode to "Allow All"
* Set Adapter type to "PCnet-FAST III"
* Set Cable connected to On
