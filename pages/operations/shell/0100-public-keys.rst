Uploading Public Keys
---------------------

You access the shell on the Fuel Master node
and the target nodes using SSH,
and you must define a Public Key to use SSH.

#. Generate a Public Key with the following command on your client:

   ::

      ssh-keygen -t rsa

#. Populate the :ref:`Public Key<public-key-ug>` field
   in the Fuel UI with this key.
   Fuel will upload this Public Key to each target node it deploys,
   but it does not upload it to nodes that are already deployed.

#. To upload the SSH key to the Fuel Master node or any deployed node,
   use the following command sequence:
   ::

      ssh-agent
      ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub root@<ip-addr>

   <*ip-addr*> is the IP address for the Fuel Master node,
   which is the same IP address you use to access the Fuel console.

   You can use this same command to add a public key
   to a deployed target node.
   See :ref:`ssh-to-target-nodes-ops` for information
   about getting the <*ip-addr*> values for the target nodes.

   You can instead add the content of your key
   (stored in the ``.ssh/id_rsa.pub`` file)
   to the node's ``/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`` file.
