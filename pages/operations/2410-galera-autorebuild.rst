HowTo: Enable/Disable Galera Cluster Autorebuild Mechanism
----------------------------------------------------------

By default, Fuel reassembles a Galera cluster automatically without any user
interaction.

  - OCF Galera script is designed to check every node in Galera Cluster for
    SEQNO position. That allows to find the node with the most recent data. 

  - The script checks for the status of the current node, If it is synchronized
    with the quorum, the procedure stops; otherwise, SEQNO will be obtained and
    stored in Corosync CIB as variable.

  - The script sleeps for 300 seconds, allowing other nodes to join the
    Corosync quorum and push their UUIDs and SEQNOs too.

  - For every node in the quorum, the script compares the UUID and SEQNO, if at
    least one node has a higher SEQNO, bootstraps the node as Primary Component
    allowing other nodes to join newly formed cluster later;

  - Primary Component node is started with `--wsrep-new-cluster` option forming
    a new quorum.

To prevent the `autorebuild feature` you should do::

  crm_resource unmanage clone_p_mysql

To re-enable `autorebuild feature` you should do::

  crm_resource manage clone_p_mysql

To check GTID and SEQNO across all nodes saved in Corosync CIB you should do::

  cibadmin --query --xpath "//nodes/*/*/nvpair[@name=\"gtid\"]"

To try an automated reassemble without reboot if cluster is broken just issue::

  crm resource restart clone_p_mysql

To remove all GTIDs and SEQNOs from Corosync CIB and allow OCF script to reread
the data from `grastate.dat` file you should do::

  cibadmin --delete-all --query --xpath "//nodes/*/*/nvpair[@name=\"gtid\"]"
  --force
