HowTo: Create a plugin
======================

Fuel 6.0 supports a pluggable architecture that allows new functionality to be added to
:ref:`Neutron<neutron-term>` and :ref:`Cinder<cinder-term>` bin a self-contained archive.

Preparing your environment
--------------------------

To prepare your environment for plugin development, follow these steps:

1.  If you have Ubuntu 12.04.2 LTS, perform:

::

        sudo apt-get install createrepo rpm dpkg-dev

If you have Centos 6.5, perform:

::


       yum install createrepo rpm dpkg-devel

2. Install Fuel plugin builder. To do that, follow these steps:

* Install pip

::

        easy_install pip


* Install fuel-plugin-builder

::

        pip install fuel-plugin-builder


Creating your plugin
--------------------

To create your Fuel plugin, follow these steps:

1. Generate the plugin structure

::

        fpb --create fuel_plugin_name

2. Your plugin must have the following structure

::

        fuel_plugin_name/
        ├── deployment_scripts
        │   └── deploy.sh
        ├── environment_config.yaml
        ├── metadata.yaml
        ├── pre_build_hook
        ├── repositories
        │   ├── centos
        │   └── ubuntu
        └── tasks.yaml


* `deployment_scripts` - directory where you can add your bash script or Puppet manifests

* `environment_config.yaml` - set plugin-specific parameters, which user can configure on UI Settings tab

* `repositories` - add Ubuntu or CentOS packages which are required for your plugin

* `tasks.yaml` - used to specify when, where and how to run your scripts

3. Build your plugin:

::

       fpb --build fuel_plugin_name/

After your plugin is built, you can see it in your plugin's directory;
for example, `fuel_plugin_name/fuel_plugin_name-0.1.0.fp` can be used.

Installing your plugin
----------------------

1. Install newer version of Fuel (6.0 or newer)
   TODO(eli): here should be a link on the instruction
   how to setup env with virtualbox scripts
   (irina)See :ref:`virtualbox`
2. Copy plugin on the master node; ssh can be used for that

::

       scp fuel_plugin_name-0.1.0.fp root@:master_node_ip:/tmp
       cd /tmp
       fuel plugins --install fuel_plugin_name-0.1.0.fp

3. After your environment is created, you will be able to see the checkbox on Settings tab.
   Use the Settings tab to enable and configure the plugin and run deployment.
