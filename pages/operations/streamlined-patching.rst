Applying streamlined patching
=============================

For the detailed description of how streamlined patching is implemented
see :ref:`Mirantis OpenStack streamlined patching<streamlined-patching-ref>`.

If you are registered at the `official Mirantis website <https://www.mirantis.com/>`_
you will receive regular email notifications on the available patches in an aggregate form.

Once you receive the email, you can click on the patching items
listed there. This will lead you to the errata portal <http://errata.mirantis.com/>`_.

At the portal you will see a list of all the available patches.
Each patching item will have detailed instructions on how to
download and apply each of them.
