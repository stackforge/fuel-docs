Maintenance Mode
=================

Overview
--------

Maintenance mode (MM) is the state of operating system when it has only
critical set of working services which are needed for basic network and
disk operations. Also node in MM is reachable with ssh from network.

You can put your system in :ref:`maintenance-mode-term` for system
repair or other service operations.

The maintenance mode is enforced by using the ``umm``
parameter in one of the following ways:

* by selecting the respective option in the boot menu in Ubuntu or CentOS;

* by forcing the reboot into maintenance mode from shell with
  the :command:`umm on` command;

* automatically, by reaching an number of unclean-reboots specified in
  ``REBOOT_COUNT`` parameters.

`Unclean reboot` means that system reboots unexpectedly without a
direct call from the user.

You can also disable the maintenance mode functionality
if you do not need it (for example, you do not want to
be automatically booted into it every time).

You can operate in maintenance mode through ssh or tty2.

A return back into normal mode is issued with the :command:`umm off`
command.

.. Note ::

  If you manually start a service in the maintenance mode, it will not
  be automatically restarted when you put the system back in the normal
  mode with the :command:`umm off` command.


Using the :command:`umm` command
--------------------------------

There are several parameters to use with the :command:`umm` command:

- ``umm on [cmd]`` - enter the maintenance mode, and execute cmd when MM is reached;

- ``umm status`` - check the mode status. There are three statuses:

  - ``runlevel`` - the system is in the normal mode.

  - ``reboot`` - the system is starting to enter the maintenance mode.

  - ``umm`` - the system is in the maintenance mode.

  - ``disabled`` - the maintenance mode functionality is disabled.

- ``umm off [reboot]`` - resume boot or reboot into normal mode.

- ``umm enable`` - enable the maintenance mode functionality.

- ``umm disable`` - disable the maintenance mode functionality.


Configuring the `UMM.conf` file
---------------------------------

You can automate the maintenance mode start by editing the `/etc/umm.conf` file.

The configuration options are:

* UMM=yes
* REBOOT_COUNT=2
* COUNTER_RESET_TIME=10


where:

UMM
  tells the system to go into the maintenance mode based on
  the ``REBOOT_COUNT`` and ``COUNTER_RESET_TIME`` values. If the value is
  anything other than ``yes`` (or if the `UMM.conf` file is missing), the
  system will go into the native Ubuntu recovery mode.

REBOOT_COUNT
  determines the number of unclean reboots that trigger the system to go
  into the maintenance mode.

COUNTER_RESET_TIME
  determines the period of time (in minutes) before the `Unclean reboot`
  counter reset.


Example of using MM on one node
-------------------------------

- Switching node into MM:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     root@node-1:~#umm on
     umm-gr start/running, process 6657

     Broadcast message from root@node-1
     (/dev/pts/0) at 14:29 ...

     The system is going down for reboot NOW!
     root@node-1:~# umm status
     rebooting
     root@node-1:~# Connection to node-1 closed by remote host.
     Connection node-1:~# closed.
     root@fuel:~#:~$

     root@node-1:~#ssh

     root@node-1:~# umm status
     umm
     root@node-1:~#ps -Af


  We can see only small set of working processes.

- Start the service:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     root@node-1:~# /etc/init.d/apache2 start
     root@node-1:~# /etc/init.d/apache2 status
     Apache2 is running (pid 1907).


- Switch back to the working mode:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     root@node-1:~#umm off

- Continue booting into working mode:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     root@node-1:~#umm status
     runlevel N 2
     root@node-1:~#/etc/init.d/apache2 status
     Apache2 is running (pid 1907).


  We can see that service was not restarted during switching from MM to
  working mode.

- Check the state of the OpenStack services:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     root@node-1:~#crm status

- If you want to reach working mode by reboot, you should use the following
  command:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     root@node-1:~# umm off reboot umm-gr start/running, process 2825

     Broadcast message from root@node-1
     (/dev/pts/0) at 11:23 ...

     The system is going down for reboot NOW!
     root@node-1:~# Connection to node-1 closed by remote host.
     Connection to node-1 closed.
     [root@fuel ~]#


Example of putting all nodes into the maintenance mode at the same time
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following maintenance mode sequence is called `Last input First out`.
This guarantees that there is going to be the most recent data on
the Cloud Infrastructure Controller (CIC) that comes back first.


- Determine which nodes have Controller (CIC) role:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     [root@fuel ~]# fuel nodes
     id | status | name             | cluster| ip        | mac               | roles      | pending_roles| online
     ---|--------|------------------|--------|-----------|-------------------|------------|--------------|-------
     2  | ready  | Untitled (c0:02) | 1      | 10.20.0.4 | e6:6a:42:96:a4:45 | controller |              | True
     4  | ready  | Untitled (c0:04) | 1      | 10.20.0.6 | 66:10:2e:0c:12:4a | compute    |              | True
     1  | ready  | Untitled (c0:01) | 1      | 10.20.0.3 | fa:a1:39:94:7f:4c | controller |              | True
     3  | ready  | Untitled (c0:03) | 1      | 10.20.0.5 | 82:cb:bb:50:40:47 | controller |              | True

- Copy ``id_rsa`` to the CICs for passwordless ssh authentification:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     [root@fuel ~]# scp .ssh/id_rsa node-1:.ssh/id_rsa
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
     id_rsa                                    100% 1675   1.6KB/s   00:00
     [root@fuel ~]# scp .ssh/id_rsa node-2:.ssh/id_rsa
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-2' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
     id_rsa                                    100% 1675   1.6KB/s   00:00
     [root@fuel ~]# scp .ssh/id_rsa node-3:.ssh/id_rsa
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-3' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
     id_rsa                                    100% 1675   1.6KB/s   00:00

- Enforce switching into MM mode on all nodes:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     [root@fuel ~]# ssh node-1 umm on ssh node-2 umm on ssh node-3 umm on
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
     umm-gr start/running, process 24318
     Connection to node-1 closed by remote host.
     Connection to node-1 closed.
     [root@fuel ~]#
     [root@fuel ~]# ssh -tt node-1 ssh -tt node-2 ssh -tt node-3 sleep 1
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

     Warning: Permanently added 'node-2,10.20.0.4' (ECDSA)

     Warning: Permanently added 'node-3,192.168.0.6' (ECDSA)
     to the list of known hosts.
     Connection to node-3 closed.
     Connection to node-2 closed.
     Connection to node-1 closed. [root@fuel ~]#

- Wait until the last node reboots:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     [root@fuel ~]# ssh node-3
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-3' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.

     Connection to node-3 closed by remote host.
     Connection to node-3 closed.
     [root@fuel ~]#

- Perform all the steps planned for MM.


- Enforce a return back into normal mode in reverse state:

  .. code-block:: bash
     :linenos:

     [root@fuel ~]# ssh node-3 umm off
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-3' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
     [root@fuel ~]# ssh node-2 umm off
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-2' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
     [root@fuel ~]# ssh node-1 umm off
     Warning: Permanently added 'node-1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
