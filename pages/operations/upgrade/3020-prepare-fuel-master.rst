Prepare Fuel Master
+++++++++++++++++++

Before you start the upgrade procedure, you must prepare your Fuel
installer. There are several changes to the default behavior and
configuration of installer that the upgrade functions depend on.
The configuration changes include installation of additional packages
and setting environment variables.

Modifications to the default behavior are implemented as patches and
are applied to multiple components of Fuel.

In this section we briefly describe which components are affected by
the change and why, and explain how to apply the patches correctly.
Explanations of specific patches and their purpose will be given below
in the sections dedicated to the steps that make use of those patches:

* :ref:`Patch to Nailgun<upgrade-patch-nailgun>`
* :ref:`Patch to Cobbler snippet<upgrade-patch-cobbler>`
* :ref:`Patch to Fuel Library modules<upgrade-patch-fuel-lib>`

See the instructions on how to apply the patches in
:ref:`Commands To Prepare The Fuel Master Node<upgrade-patch-commands>`.

Install the Upgrade Script
__________________________

The upgrade logic is automated in the script named ``octane``.
You need to download and install this script from RPM repository
on your Fuel Master node.

Install packages
________________

Changes to the Fuel installer configuration include installation
of additional packages. These packages are present in the standard Fuel
repository, but not installed by default. Utils provided by these
packages are used by the upgrade functions at different stages of the
process. The upgrade procedure requires the following packages
installed on the Fuel Master node:

* `pssh`
* `patch`
* `postgresql.x86_64`

.. _upgrade-patch-nailgun:

Patch to Nailgun
________________

This patch will allow Nailgun to handle the parameter of the disk
metadata that identifies it as used for Ceph OSD device. This parameter
is passed to Cobbler and is used to disable the erasing and formatting
of the device.

.. _upgrade-patch-cobbler:

Patch to Cobbler
________________

This patch will allow Cobbler to identify the disks and partitions
used for Ceph OSD devices and preserve data on those partitions through
the installation process. It modifies the ``pmanager.py`` module.

.. _upgrade-patch-fuel-lib:

Patches to Fuel Library
_______________________

When installing CIC, Puppet uses Fuel Library of modules to configure
the services and devices on the node. This includes initialization
of disks that are used for Ceph OSD. To preserve data, we need to change
the module to skip the initialization of a particular disk depending on
the metadata parameters. The first patch to Fuel Library adds handling
for the 'keep' parameter in disk metadata.

We also need to disable creation of test networks by Fuel.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to do so with the pure Puppet
configuration, so we need to modify the manifest to allow an
empty ``predefined_nets`` list.

Prepare environment variables
_____________________________

There are several variables that need to be set before you start
the upgrade procedure. They will be used throughout the whole process.
These variables include the ID and name of the environment picked
for the upgrade.

Commands To Prepare The Fuel Master Node
________________________________________

To download the script, you first need to install ``git`` version
control system onto the Fuel Master node:

::

    yum install -y git

Once you have ``git`` installed, clone the repository with the script
and libs into the current directory:

::

    git clone -b stable/6.1 https://github.com/Mirantis/octane.git

Now change to the directory that contains executable files including
the ``octane`` script itself:

::

    cd octane/octane/bin

The upgrade script prepares the Fuel Master node with a single command:

::

    ./octane prepare
