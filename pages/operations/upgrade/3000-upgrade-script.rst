Upgrade Script
--------------

In this chapter we explain how exactly we implement the steps described in the
:ref:`Solution Overview<upg_sol>`. Sections of this chapter contain appendices
with listings of commands and scripts that implement each particular action.

.. IMPORTANT::

    * All commands in this section must be executed on the Fuel Master node,
      unless specified otherwise.
    * You must use ``bash`` shell to execute commands.
    * All commands must be executed one after another in a single continuous
      ``bash`` session. Otherwise, the required variables won't be set, and most
      commands will fail.
