Accessing the shell on the nodes
================================

Many maintenance and advanced configuration tasks
require that you access the Fuel Master and target nodes
at the shell level.
All these systems run the **bash** shell
and support standard Linux system commands.
Each system has its own console that you can use directly
but the standard practice is to use SSH
to access the consoles of the different nodes.
