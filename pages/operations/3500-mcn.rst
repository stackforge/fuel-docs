Configuring a Multiple Cluster Network (MCN)
============================================

Multiple Cluster Networks (MCNs) are configured
using :ref:`fuel CLI<cli_usage>` commands
that are run after Fuel is installed
but before booting the target node servers.
For background information about how the MCN feature is implemented,
see :ref:`mcn-arch`.

Requirements for an environment that runs multiple cluster networks are:

- Must use an encapsulation protocol
  such as :ref:`Neutron GRE<neutron-gre-ovs-arch>`.

- A gateway must be defined for each
  :ref:`logical network<logical-networks-arch>`
  when the cluster has multiple Node Groups.

- All controllers must be members of the same Node Group;
  if they are not, the :ref:`HAProxy<haproxy-term>` VIP does not work.

  .. note:: It is possible to use ECMP to work around this restriction;
     documenting how to do this is beyond the scope of this document.

To configure multiple cluster networks,
do the following.

#.  Add each DHCP network into the
    :ref:`dnsmasq.template<dnsmasq-template-ref>` file.

#. Start a **dhcp-helper** or **dhcprelay(8)** process:

   .. code-block:: sh

      dhcp-helper -s <IP-addr-of-alpha_admin network> -i <virtual-IP-of-beta_admin-network>

#. Create each new Node Group with a command like this:

   .. code-block:: sh

      fuel --env 1 nodegroup --create --name "alpha"

   Assign a different integer to each `group` you create.

#. Configure the new Network Group(s) by uploading a new
   :ref:`network-1.yaml<network-1-yaml-ref>` file
   and populating it as discussed in the reference page,
   then upload the modified file.

#. Boot the nodes for all environments.

#. When you assign roles to your target nodes,
   Fuel tries to automatically determine the node's group based on the DHCP address.
   If that fails, the group can be manually assigned with the following command:

   ::

     fuel nodegroup --env 1 --assign --node <list-of-node-ids> --group <nodegroup-id>
