Logs and messages
-----------------

A number of logs are available
to help you understand and troubleshoot
what is going on in your environment.

.. _screen-messages-tshoot:

Screen messages
+++++++++++++++

Clicking on the icon in the upper right corner
of the Fuel UI displays a drop-down menu
of notifications posted as the environment was deployed.
If notifications have been posted
that you have not yet viewed,
this icon is an orange square with a number
that indicates the number of unread notifications.
If there are no unread notifications,
the icon looks as it does here:

.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/messages.png
   :width: 80%

These notifications tell you about the nodes that were deployed
and when nodes go on and offline.
Click on any notification
to get a summary configuration view of the node.

Viewing Logs through Fuel
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Logs tab on the Fuel UI allows you to view
key logs for any node in the environment.
Use the drop-down list on the left to select
whether to view Fuel Master logs
or the logs of other servers in the environment.

Viewing Fuel Master logs
++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you choose the "Fuel Master" logs,
you get this display:

.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/master-logs.png
   :width: 80%

The following logs can be chosen from the "Source" list
for the "Fuel Master" node:

:puppet:

:anaconda:

:syslog:  Shows the **syslog** entries
          that will be sent to the **rsyslog** server
          (Fuel Master by default).



**Other install logs**

:storage:

:kickstart-pre:

:kickstart-post:


**Bootstrap logs**

:Web backend:  Logs each connection from the Master Node
               to the Internet.

:REST API:

:RPC consumer:

:Astute:  Records the activity of the :ref:`astute-term` agents
          that implements the :ref:`nailgun-term` configuration tasks.

:Health Check:  Displays the results of the most recent run
                of the tests run from the "Health Check" tab.

Viewing logs for target nodes ("Other servers")
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you choose "Other Servers",
the display includes an extra field
that you use to choose the node whose logs you want to view:

.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/other-nodes-logs.png
   :width: 80%

Many of the same logs shown for the Fuel Master node
are also shown for the target nodes.
The difference is in the nodes given for "Bootstrap logs",
plus the controller node includes a set of OpenStack logs
that shows logs for services that run on the Controller node.

The "Bootstrap logs" for "Other servers" are:

**Bootstrap logs**

:dmesg:  Standard Linux dmesg log that displays log messages
         from the most recent system startup.

:messages:  Logs all kernel messages for the node.

:mcollective:

:agent:

syslog
++++++

OpenStack uses the standard Linux **syslog**/**rsyslog** facilities
to manage logging in the environment.
Fuel puts the appropriate templates
into the */etc/rsyslog.d* directory
on each target node.

By default, Fuel sets up the Fuel Master node
to be the remote syslog server.
See :ref:`syslog-ug` for instructions about
how to configure the environment
to use a different server as the **rsyslog** server.
Note that Fuel configures all the files required for **rsyslog**
when you use the Fuel Master node as the remote server;
if you specify another server,
you must configure that server to handle messages
from the OpenStack environment.
