Screen messages
+++++++++++++++

Clicking on the icon in the upper right corner
of the Fuel UI displays a drop-down menu
of notifications posted as the environment was deployed.
If notifications have been posted
that you have not yet viewed,
this icon is an orange square with a number
that indicates the number of unread notifications.
If there are no unread notifications,
the icon looks as it does here:

These notifications tell you about the nodes that were deployed.
Click on any notification
to get a summary configuration view of the node.
