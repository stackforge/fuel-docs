Sahara Deployment
=================

Sahara is a service for launching Hadoop clusters on OpenStack.
It is vendor-agnostic and currently supports two distributions:
Vanilla Apache Hadoop and Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP).

Sahara can install Hadoop clusters on demand.
The user must populate several parameters
such as the Hadoop version and cluster topology
and Sahara will deploy this cluster in a few minutes.
It can also scale the cluster by adding or removing nodes as needed.

- For Sahara usage guidelines, read the User Guide section of the
  `Sahara documentation <http://sahara.readthedocs.org/en/stable-icehouse/>`_.

- For more information about the pre-built images
  for Hadoop cluster provisioning, follow the documentation link above
  and look at the page for the appropriate plugin (vanilla or HDP).
  The images are usually provided in a QCOW2 format which works with the
  default OpenStack hypervisors Qemu/KVM. If the cloud is installed with a
  different hypervisor the image should be converted to an appropriate format
  before being uploaded to Glance. The instructions for the Vmware Nova backend
  are here :ref:`sahara-vmware`.

- Planning considerations for running Sahara are in :ref:`sahara-plan`.
- Installation instructions for Sahara are in :ref:`sahara-install`

This section provides additional information
about running Sahara.
