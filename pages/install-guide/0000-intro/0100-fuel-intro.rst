Introducing Fuel for OpenStack
------------------------------

Mirantis Fuel for OpenStack is a set of deployment tools that helps you to
quickly deploy your cloud environment. Fuel includes the scripts that
dramatically facilitate and speed up the process of cloud deployment.
Typically, OpenStack installation requires you familiarize yourself
with the processes of installation of OpenStack environment components.
Fuel eliminates the need to study these processes. With Fuel, system
administrators can provision an OpenStack single node, as well as
clustered cloud in terms of minutes.
