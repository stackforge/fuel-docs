Deployment Modes
-----------------------------

You can use Fuel for OpenStack to create virtually any OpenStack
configuration. However, Mirantis provides several pre-defined
architectures for your convenience.
The pre-defined architectures include:
 
* **Multi-node**
  The Multi-node environment provides an easy way
  to install an entire OpenStack environment without requiring the degree
  of increased hardware involved in ensuring high availability.
  Mirantis recommends that you use this architecture for testing
  purposes.
 
* **Multi-node HA**
  The Multi-node with HA environment is dedicated for highly available
  production deployments. Using Multi-node with HA you can deploy
  additional services, such as Cinder, Neutron, and Ceph.
  You can create the following multi-node environments:

With Fuel, you can create your own cloud environment that includes
additional components.
