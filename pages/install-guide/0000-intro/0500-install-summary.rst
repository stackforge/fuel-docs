Fuel Installation Procedures
----------------------------
You must complete the following tasks to use Fuel to deploy OpenStack
clouds:

1. Install the Fuel Master Node on physical or virtual hardware using
   the Fuel installation image
2. Set the other nodes to boot from the network and power them on
   to make them accessible for Fuel Master node
3. Assign your desired roles to the discovered nodes using Fuel
   UI or CLI.

Fuel is designed to maintain the OpenStack environment while providing
the flexibility to adapt it to your configuration.
