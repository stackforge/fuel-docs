PXE Booting Settings
--------------------

By default, `eth0` on Fuel Master node serves PXE requests. If you are planning 
to use another interface, you configure this in :ref:`Network_Install`.

If you want to install Fuel on virtual machines, then you need to make sure
that dnsmasq on the Master node is configured to support the PXE client used by 
your virtual machines. We enable *dhcp-no-override* option because without it,
dnsmasq tries to move ``PXE filename`` and ``PXE servername`` special fields 
into DHCP options. Not all PXE implementations can recognize those options and 
therefore they will not be able to boot. For example, libvirt in CentOS 6.4 
uses gPXE implementation, instead of more advanced iPXE by default, and 
therefore requires *dhcp-no-override*
