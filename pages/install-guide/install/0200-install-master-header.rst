Installing Fuel Master Node
===========================

.. contents :local:

Fuel is distributed via both ISO and IMG images. Each contains an installer for 
Fuel Master node. The ISO image is used for CD media devices, iLO (HP) or 
similar remote access systems. The IMG file is used for USB memory stick-based
installation.

Once installed, Fuel can be used to deploy and manage OpenStack environments. 
It will assign IP addresses to the nodes, perform PXE boot and initial 
configuration, and provision of OpenStack nodes according to their roles in 
the environment.
