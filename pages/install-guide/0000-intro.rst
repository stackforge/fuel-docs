Introduction to the Installation Guide
======================================
This guide gives instructions about:

- How to configure the hardware
  to be used for your OpenStack environment
- How to download and install the Fuel Master Node and tools
  that you will use to deploy your OpenStack environment.

This is the second part of a three-document set
with details to get you started with Mirantis OpenStack and Fuel.

- Before you do the procedures in this document,
  you should work through the information in
  the :ref:`Pre-install_Guide` to plan your Mirantis OpenStack environment.

- After you complete the tasks in this document
  and your Fuel Master Node is up and running,
  go to the :ref:`User_Guide` for detailed instructions about
  how to use the Fuel graphical screens to deploy your OpenStack cloud.

Other documents in the set provide addtional information:

- :ref:`terminology` is an alphabetical listing
  of technologies and concepts
  that serves as both a glossary and a master index
  to information in the Mirantis docs and other sources of information.
- :ref:`operations-guide` gives information about advanced tasks
  required to maintain the OpenStack environment after it is deployed.
  Most of these tasks are done in the shell
  using text editors and command line tools.
- :ref:`ref-arch` provides background information
  about how OpenStack works.

For community members and partners looking to take Fuel even further,
see the `developer documentation <http://docs.mirantis.com/fuel-dev/develop.html>`_
for information about the internal architecture of Fuel,
instructions for building the project,
information about interacting with the REST API
and other topics of interest to more advanced developers.
