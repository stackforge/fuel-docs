Understanding and Configuring the Network
=========================================

OpenStack environments use several types of network managers: FlatDHCPManager, 
VLANManager (Nova Network) and Neutron (formerly Quantum). All configurations 
are supported. For more information about how the network managers work, you 
can read these two resources:
