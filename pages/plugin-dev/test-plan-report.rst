Template for Test Plan

TBD

Test Plan for the Fuel plug-in must contain description
of the plug-in functionality alongside with the compatible
Mirantis OpenStack releases: plug-in developer must
provide this input information in the form of the plug-in specification.

Test Plan must also contain specific test cases.

Fuel QA team then runs test cases from the Test Plan and compares
the obtained results with the ones described in the Test Report.

Note that plug-ins are certified for the whole Mirantis OpenStack
release series.
