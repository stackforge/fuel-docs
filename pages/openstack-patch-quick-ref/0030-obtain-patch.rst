Obtain a patch
==============

You can obtain patches in three different ways:

* In some cases, the community or an OpenStack distribution vendor supplies a pre-generated patch for download.

* For stable release bugfix updates, you can download a cumulative version of OpenStack packages that each contains the fixes for that component.

* You can also download patches from github.com, git.openstack.org (also the repository browser), and directly from local git repository. Examples of using these methods follow.

.. note:: The first two methods can only generate patches for a single commit. If you need to generate a patch from changes resulting from many commits, use the git method.
