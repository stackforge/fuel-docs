**/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/nailgun/fixtures*

The *xxx.yaml* file defines
the basic configuration of the target nodes

Initially, it contains Fuel defaults;
these are adjusted in response to configuration choices
the user makes through the Fuel UI
and then fed to :ref:`Nailgun<nailgun-term>`.
