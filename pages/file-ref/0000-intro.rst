Fuel File Reference Pages
=========================

This section provides reference pages
for select configuration files that Fuel uses.

.. warning::  Be very careful when modifying the configuration files.
   A simple typo when editing these files
   may severely damage your environment.

   When you modify the YAML files,
   you will receive a warning
   that some attributes were modified from the outside.
   Some features may become inaccessible
   from the  UI after you do this.
