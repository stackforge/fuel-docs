System requirements
===================

This section describes how to configure hardware nodes to
accommodate your OpenStack workloads. Since there are many possible use cases
for an OpenStack environment, the number and configurations of your servers
will also vary. While this section provides clear hardware requirements for the
Fuel Master node, it can only provide guidelines on how to configure the Fuel
Slave nodes. For reference, a sample hardware configuration of
a medium-sized OpenStack environment is described at the end of this section.

This section includes the following topics:

* :ref:`Network requirements <sysreqs_network_reqs>`
* :ref:`Storage requirements <sysreq_storge_reqs>`
* :ref:`Sample hardware architecture <sysreqs_sample_target_node_config>`
