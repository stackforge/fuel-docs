System requirements
===================

This section describes how to configure hardware nodes to
accommodate your OpenStack workloads. Since there are many options
to use an OpenStack environment, the number and configurations of your servers
will also vary. While we provide clear hardware requirements for the
Fuel Master node, we can provide only guidelines on how to configure
the Fuel Target nodes. For reference, a sample hardware configuration of
a medium-sized OpenStack environment is described at the end of this section.
