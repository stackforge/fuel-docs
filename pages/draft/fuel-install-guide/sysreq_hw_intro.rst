Hardware requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Planning hardware requirements for an OpenStack environment is a complex task
that requires analysis of the applications that you plan to run in your cloud,
as well as understanding how your cloud will expand over time. Therefore, the
hardware requirements for Fuel Slave nodes will differ for each use case.
However, hardware requirements for Fuel Master node are identical for all
deployments.
