Fuel upgrade table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* If you are running Fuel 4.x or earlier, you cannot upgrade to 7.0.
* If you are running Fuel 5.x, you cannot upgrade *directly* to 7.0.
  You will need to upgrade from 5.x to 6.x first, and then you can
  upgrade to 7.0.
* If you are running Fuel 6.x, you can upgrade to Fuel 7.0.

The following table summarizes the available progressions
for upgrades of the Fuel Master node:

.. note::

    *  Fuel 7.0 can only deploy 7.0 environments.

    *  Fuel 7.0 can manage environments deployed with Fuel 6.x provided that
       the Fuel Master node was upgraded to 7.0 rather than freshly installed.
       You can always check environment versions that you can manage on the
       "Releases" tab of your Fuel web UI.
