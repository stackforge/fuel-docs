   guidelines and : ref : intro_planning.

#. Verify your hardware using the : ref : Hardware checklist.

#. Determine whether the server on which you plan to install the Fuel
   Master node is connected to the Internet.

 * If the server does not have an Internet
   connection, then you must configure a local repository. For more
   information, see: : ref : Set up a local repository .
