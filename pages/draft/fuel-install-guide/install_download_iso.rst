Download the ISO image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Fuel ISO image includes Fuel software components, as well as the
latest release of OpenStack which is required to create your OpenStack
environment. Therefore, if you use Fuel, you do not need to download any
additional OpenStack components.

However, the Fuel ISO does not include the operating system packages. Fuel
Master node dynamically downloads the packages from the configured software
repository.

**To download the ISO image:**

#. Go to the Fuel project page.
#. Download the ISO to a location on your computer.
#. Proceed to :ref:`Prepare the installation media`
