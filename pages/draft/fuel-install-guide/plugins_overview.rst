Fuel plugins overview
=====================

Fuel allows installing plugins before you deploy your environment.
Plugins are downloadable software components that extend the functionality of your
environments in a flexible, repeatable and reliable manner.

For example, `Neutron VPNaaS`_ provides flexible IPSec VPN feature-set supported by Neutron CLI and,
more simply, in Horizon, by adding a new set of tabs to Network. 

Validation
----------

The Fuel Plugins Validation is a set of technical and business
processes that Mirantis uses to verify Fuel plugins built by vendors,
allowing a customer's choice of plugins to lead to a predictable outcome.
That means, Mirantis Validation ensures the quality of developed solution.

In terms of Validation, Fuel plugins fall into two categories:

* *Validated* - thoroughly reviewed, tested, and supported by Mirantis.

* *Non-Validated* - reviewed, tested in terms of code and installation procedure,
  but not supported by Mirantis.

See the validation requirements at `Fuel plugin validation page`_.

You can find the list of the validated plugins at `Fuel plugins catalog`_.

For information on development requirements and FAQ, see `Fuel Plugins SDK`_.
