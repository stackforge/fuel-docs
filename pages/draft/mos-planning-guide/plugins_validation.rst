Plugins Validation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Validation is the process the Mirantis Partner Enablement team uses
to ensure the provided plugin can be used with Mirantis OpenStack.

In terms of Validation, Fuel plugins fall into two categories:

* *Validated* - thoroughly reviewed, tested, and supported by Mirantis.
* *Non-Validated* - reviewed, tested in terms of code and installation procedure,
  but not supported by Mirantis.
