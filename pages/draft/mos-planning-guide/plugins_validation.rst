Validation
==========

The Fuel Plugins Validation is a set of technical and business
processes that Mirantis uses to verify Fuel plugins built by vendors,
allowing a customer's choice of plugins to lead to a predictable outcome.
That means, Mirantis Validation ensures the quality of developed solution.

In terms of Validation, Fuel plugins fall into two categories:

* *Validated* - thoroughly reviewed, tested, and supported by Mirantis.
* *Non-Validated* - reviewed, tested in terms of code and installation procedure,
  but not supported by Mirantis.
