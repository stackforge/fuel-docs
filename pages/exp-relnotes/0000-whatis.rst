What is Mirantis OpenStack Express
==================================

Mirantis OpenStack Express is your own on-demand data center powered by OpenStack.
Deploy, develop, or go to production with the cloud – in under an hour,
all in one cloud-based service you run right from your web browser.
And Mirantis OpenStack Express is entirely pay-as-you go;
you can avoid 6-to-7 figure capital investments on hardware,
software and systems integration before your cloud is ready.

Using the convenience of a cloud service coupled with credit card billing,
Mirantis OpenStack Express gives you a secure fully isolated platform.
With a choice of data centers in North America, Europe and Asia,
you get dedicated bare metal servers, networks,
and a ready-to-use OpenStack platform.
Then, you are free to set up and control VMs and everything else in the cluster,
to run your cloud right from your own dedicated OpenStack console over the internet – all backed by Mirantis 24x7 global customer support.
