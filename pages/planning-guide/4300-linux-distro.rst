Linux Distribution for Nodes
============================

Fuel allows you to deploy either the CentOS or Ubuntu
Linux distribution as the Host O/S on the nodes.
All nodes in the environment must run the same Linux distribution.
Often, the choice is made based on personal preference;
many administrative tasks on the nodes
must be performed at shell level
and many people choose the distribution
with which they are most comfortable.

Some specific considerations:

- Each distribution has some hardware support issues.
  See :ref:`release-notes` for details about known issues.
- In particular, the CentOS version used for OpenStack
  does not include native support for VLANs
  while the Ubuntu version does.
  In order to use VLANs on CentOS based nodes,
  you must configure :ref:`vlan-splinters-ug`.
- CentOS supports .rpm packages; Ubuntu supports .deb packages.
