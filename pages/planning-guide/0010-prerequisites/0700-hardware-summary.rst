Summary
----------

In general, your best bet is to choose a 2 socket server with a balance in I/O, 
CPU, Memory, and Disk that meets your project requirements. 
Look for a 1U R-class or 2U high density C-class servers. Some good options 
from Dell for compute nodes include:

* Dell PowerEdge R620
* Dell PowerEdge C6220 Rack Server
* Dell PowerEdge R720XD (for high disk or IOPS requirements)

You may also want to consider systems from HP (http://www.hp.com/servers) or 
from a smaller systems builder like Aberdeen, a manufacturer that specializes 
in powerful, low-cost systems and storage servers (http://www.aberdeeninc.com).
