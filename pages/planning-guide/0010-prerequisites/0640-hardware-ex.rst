Hardware for this example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, you are looking at:

* 2 data switches (for HA), each with a minimum of 12 ports for data 
  (2 x 1 Gb links per server x 6 servers)
* 1 x 1 Gb switch for IPMI (1 port per server x 6 servers)
* Optional Cluster Management switch, plus a second for HA

Because your network will in all likelihood grow, it's best to choose 48 port 
switches. Also, as your network grows, you will need to consider uplinks and 
aggregation switches.
