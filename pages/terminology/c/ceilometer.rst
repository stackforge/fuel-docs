Ceilometer (OpenStack Telemetry)
--------------------------------

Ceilometer aggregates usage and performance data
across all the services deployed in an OpenStack environment.
This data provides visibility and insight
into the usage of the cloud across dozens of data points
and allows cloud operators to view metrics globally
or by individual deployed resources.
The information gathered can be used for monitoring and capacity planning,
or to create an alarming service,
or can serve data to external software for a customer billing system.
The framework can be expanded to collect measurements for other needs.

Fuel can install Ceilometer on systems running
either the CentOS or Ubuntu operating system;
check the appropriate box when configuring your environment.
