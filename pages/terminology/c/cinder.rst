Cinder
------
Cinder is the code name for the OpenStack Block Storage project.
Cinder was originally part of the Nova project
but is now an independent core OpenStack project.
For more information, see the
`Cinder developer documentation <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/cinder/>`_.

Cinder can be deployed on its own OpenStack storage node
(often called a "Cinder node")
or can share a Controller node.
For information about deploying Cinder in Mirantis OpenStack,
see `Storage Architecture <http://docs.mirantis.com/fuel/fuel-4.1/reference-architecture.html#storage-architecture>`_.

The :ref:`vcenter-term` driver
provides vSphere datastore drivers for Cinder block storage.
