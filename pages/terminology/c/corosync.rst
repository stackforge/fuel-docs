Corosync
--------
The Corosync Cluster Engine is a Group Communication System
with additional features for implementing high availability within applications.
See the `Corosync home page <http://corosync.github.io/corosync/>`_
for more information.
For a good discussion about Pacemaker and Corosync
and how they are related, see
`What is Pacemaker? <http://clusterlabs.org/doc/en-US/Pacemaker/1.1/html-single/Clusters_from_Scratch/#_what_is_pacemaker>`_.

Mirantis OpenStack uses Corosync with the Pacemaker cluster resource manager
as the communication and quorum service.
