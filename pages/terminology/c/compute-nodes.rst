Compute nodes (OpenStack Compute)
---------------------------------

Compute servers are the workhorses of your installation;
they are the servers on which your users' virtual machines are created.
`nova-compute` controls the life cycle of these VMs.

See the `Compute web site <http://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-compute/>`_
