Logging
-------

OpenStack and Fuel use the standard
Linux **syslog** and **rsyslog** facilities
for logging events on the Fuel Master Node
and on the nodes in the OpenStack environment.

See the following:

- :ref:`syslog-ug` tells how to configure your environment
  to use a remote server as the **rsyslog** server
  rather than use the Fuel Master Node as the **rsyslog** server
  for the environment.

- :ref:`debug-level-ug` tells how to configure debug logging
  for the environment.

- :ref:`logs-top-tshoot` discusses
