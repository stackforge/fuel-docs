LXC (Linux containers) are peacemeal containers
that can be modified, upgraded, and backed up independently.
LXC is a user space interface to the Linux kernel containment features.
See `LXC <https://linuxcontainers.org/>`_

OpenStack is phasing in support for LXC containers
using :ref:`docker-term`.
