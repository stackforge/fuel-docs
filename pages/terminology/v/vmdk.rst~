VMDK
----

The VMDK driver provides support for the virtual machine
disk format used by VMware.
This driver is used to enable management of the OpenStack Block Storage volumes
on vCenter-managed data stores.
Volumes are backed by VMDK files on data stores that use any VMware compatible
storage technology such as NFS, iSCSI, FiberChannel, and vSAN.
You can use Fuel 5.1 and later to deploy a vCenter integrated Mirantis
OpenStack environment that utilizes VMDK support.
