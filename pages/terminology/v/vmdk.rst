VMDK
----

The :ref:`vcenter-term` VMDK driver
provides support for the virtual machine disk format
used by VMware :ref:`esxi-term`.
This driver is used to store Cinder volumes
and Nova ephemeral drives in data stores that are managed by vCenter.
You can use Fuel 5.1 and later
to deploy a Mirantis OpenStack environment
that utilizes VMDK support.
