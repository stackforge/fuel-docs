VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
---------------------------------

A VLAN is a set of ports that form a logical Ethernet segment
on an Ethernet switch.
The ports of a VLAN form an independent traffic domain
in which the traffic generated by the nodes
remains within the VLAN.
This allows you to use the switch management software
to group nodes with related functions
into their own separate, logical LAN segments.
