VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
---------------------------------

A VLAN is a set of ports that form a logical Ethernet segment
on an Ethernet switch.
The ports of a VLAN form an independent traffic domain
in which the traffic generated by the nodes
remains within the VLAN.
This allows you to use the switch management software
to group nodes with related functions
into their own separate, logical LAN segments.
Fuel deploys Nova-network VLAN Manager topologies,
Neutron with VLAN segmentation,
and Neutron GRE has VLAN tags
on the management, storage, and public networks.

The version of CentOS that Fuel deploys
has poor support for VLAN tagged packets
so work-aronds are provided to improve the VLAN support
when using CentOS;
see :ref:`vlan-splinters-ug`.

For more information:

- :ref:`neutron-vlan-ovs-arch` describes the Neutron VLAN topology.
  :ref:`neutron-config-vlan` provides examples
  to help you plan your NIC assignment for this topology.

- :ref:`nova-vlan-arch` describes the Nova-network VLAN topology.
  :ref:`nova-config-vlan` provides examples
  to help you plan your NIC assignment for this topology.

- :ref:`vlan-splinters-ug` gives instructions for setting up
  VLAN splinters, which improve the performance of VLANs
  when using the CentOS operating system
  for your OpenStack nodes.
