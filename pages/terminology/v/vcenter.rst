vCenter
-------

vCenter is a server that is installed on a Windows or Linux server
as a centralized management application
to manage virtual machines and :ref:`esxi-term` hosts.
VMWare licenses vCenter as an add-on to the :ref:`vsphere-term` suite.

You use Fuel 5.0 and later
to deploy a Mirantis OpenStack environment
that utilizes vCenter as a hypervisor
over the nova-compute driver
and can boot and manage VMs in vCenter.

- For information about planning your OpenStack deployment
  with vCenter integration, see :ref:`vcenter-plan`
- For information about deploying Mirantis OpenStack with
  vCenter integration, see :ref:`vcenter-deploy`.
- For background information about how vCenter support
  is implemented in Mirantis OpenStack, see :ref:`vcenter-arch`.
