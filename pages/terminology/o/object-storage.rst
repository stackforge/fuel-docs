Object Storage
--------------
Provides a fully distributed, API-accessible storage platform
that can be integrated directly into applications
or used for backup, archiving, and data retention.
This is not a traditional file system
but rather a distributed storage system for static data
such as virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage,
backups, and archives.
Objects and files are written to multiple disk drives
spread across different servers in the data center;
the OpenStack software ensures data replication and integrity
across the cluster.
