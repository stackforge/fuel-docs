OVS (Open vSwitch)
------------------
Multilayer virtual switch that the Neutron networking model uses
to create a flexible network setup
and to isolate tenants from each other on L2 and L3 layers.
You can do some basic configuration of OVS
on the Fuel UI beginning with Fuel 4.1;
additional customization can be done
by editing configuration files and using the command-line tools;
see :ref:`ovs-arch`.
