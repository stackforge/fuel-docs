Orchestration Service
---------------------

OpenStack Orchestration is a template-driven engine
that allows application developers
to describe and automate the deployment of infrastructure.
The flexible template language can specify
compute, storage and networking configurations
as well as detailed post-deployment activity
to automate the full provisioning of infrastructure
as well as services and applications.
Through integration with the Telemetry service,
the Orchestration engine can also perform
auto-scaling of certain infrastructure elements.
