Heat
----

Heat is the OpenStack Orchestration service.
It implements a framework that manages the lifecycle
of your infrastructure inside the OpenStack cloud.
Mirantis OpenStack 4.0 and later
deploys Heat into each environment by default.
Heat uses templates to describe the deployment process of instances,
but also supports the AWS CloudFormation template format.

Heat uses a template that can be maintained under source code control.
See the `Heat wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat>`_
for more information.

The Heat components are:

**heat-api** -- provides a native REST API and processes API requests.

**heat-api-cfn** -- similar to the *heat-api*
but also provides an AWS CloudFormation compatible API.

**heat-engine** -- main component of the Heat framework.
It does all the work of reading templates,
launching instances and providing events to the API users.
