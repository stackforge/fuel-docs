Hypervisor
----------
A hypervisor creates and runs virtual machines.
OpenStack runs a hypervisor as a component of the compute node.
You can select the KVM, QEMU, or
:ref:`VMware vCenter<vcenter-term>`  hypervisor from the Fuel UI;
other hypervisors are available through
`Mirantis Services <http://www.mirantis.com/openstack-services>`_.
See the `HypervisorSupportMatrix <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix>`_
web page for information about the status of other hypervisors for OpenStack.
