Host Aggregates
---------------

A host aggregate is a grouping of hosts;
one host can be in more than one host aggregate.
Host aggregates are only exposed to cloud administrators.

You can assign a :ref:`availability zone`<availability-zone-term>` name
to a host aggregate.
Users can then request that availability zone
when creating an instance.

For more information, see:

- `Segregating your Cloud <http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ops/content/scaling.html#Availability_Zones_and_Host_Aggregates>`_
  provides good conceptual information,
  although it is out-dated in that it still requires
  configuration changes to the *nova.conf* file.
