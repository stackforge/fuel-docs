Hardened packages in Mirantis OpenStack
---------------------------------------

Hardened packages in Mirantis OpenStack
include the core OpenStack projects,
updated with each stable release of OpenStack,
and supporting a broad range of operating systems,
hypervisors, and deployment topologies.
Also included are:

* Packages to ensure High Availability.
* Fixes for defects reported by our customers
  that may not yet have been merged into the community source.
* Mirantis-driven premium OpenStack projects
  such as Sahara (which provides a simple means to provision
  a Hadoop cluster on top of OpenStack)
  and Murano (an application catalog that can be used
  to publish apps and compose reliable environments out of them.)
* Mirantis-certified partner plug-ins, drivers, and integrations.

By default, Mirantis OpenStack,
enables features that Mirantis has certified
and confirmed as production-ready.
It also includes some "experimental" features,
which are new features
that are less-hardened but are integrated into the product
for customers who can tolerate some risk.
See :ref:`experimental-features-op`
for information about enabling these experimental features.
