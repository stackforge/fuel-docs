Zabbix Server
-------------

The Zabbix Server role runs the main :ref:`Zabbix<zabbix-term>` processes
and hosts the Zabbix database.
This role is displayed only when
:ref:`experimental features<experimental-features-term>` are enabled.
Fuel does not allow this role to be assigned
to a node that has other roles.
