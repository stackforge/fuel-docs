Ephemeral storage
-----------------

Ephemeral storage is used for scratch space
and as temporary storage for the operating system in a guest VM.
Ephemeral storage is allocated for an instance;
its size is determined by the flavor of the instance.
Ephemeral storage persists through a reboot of the guest operating system
but is deleted when the instance is deleted.
