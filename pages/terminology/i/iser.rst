iSER
------
iSER stands for "iSCSI Extensions for :ref:`rdma-term`".
It is an extension of the data transfer model of iSCSI,
a storage networking standard for TCP/IP.
iSER enables the iSCSI protocol to take advantage of
the RDMA protocol suite to supply higher bandwidth
for block storage transfers (zero time copy behavior).
To that fact, it eliminates the TCP/IP processing overhead
while preserving the compatibility with iSCSI protocol.
