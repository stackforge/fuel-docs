Image Service
-------------

The OpenStack Image Service provides discovery,
registration and delivery services for disk and server images.
The ability to copy or snapshot a server image
and immediately store it away
is a powerful capability of the OpenStack cloud operating system.
A stored image can be used as a template
to get new servers up and running quickly and consistently;
it can also be used to store and catalog an unlimited number of backups.

The Image Service can store disk and server images in a variety of back-ends,
including OpenStack Object Storage.
The Image Service API provides a standard REST interface
for querying information about disk images
and lets clients stream the images to new servers.

Capabilities of the Image Service include:

* Administrators can create base templates
  from which their users can start new compute instances
* Users can choose from available images,
  or create their own images from existing servers
* Snapshots can be stored in the Image Service
  so that virtual machines can be backed up quickly
* A multi-format image registry,
  the image service allows uploads of private and public images
  in a variety of formats, including
  Raw, Machine (kernel/ramdisk outside of image, a.k.a. AMI),
  VHD (Hyper-V), VDI (VirtualBox), qcow2 (Qemu/KVM),
  VMDK (VMWare), and OVF (VMWare, others).

Pacemaker uses an OpenStack Resource Agent
to manage the Image Service in OpenStack High Availability deployments.
