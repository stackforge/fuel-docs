Node group
----------

A node group is a set of nodes,
grouped by networks;
a cluster is a set of node groups.
This is a :ref:`nailgun-term` concept
that is introduced to support the
:ref:`Multiple Cluster Networks<mcn-arch>` feature
in Fuel 6.0 and later.

See:

- :ref:`mcn-ops`

- :ref:`mcn-arch`

- :ref:`fuel-cli-node-group` lists the Fuel CLI commands
  for managing node groups.
