----
OpenStack Core project used for compute nodes;
all major Nova components can be run on multiple servers
and use message queues for communication between components.
See the `Nova web page <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/>`_
for more information.

The Baremetal driver used for provisioning in Nova
has recently been forked into its own project; see "Ironic".
