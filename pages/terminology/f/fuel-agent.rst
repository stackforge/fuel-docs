Fuel Agent
----------

The Fuel Agent provisions an OpenStack environment
using pre-built images that are written to the target nodes
rather than running the native operating system installation mechanisms
on each node.
This significantly reduces the time required
to deploy a new environment or a new node.
Fuel Agent is introduced as
an :ref:`experimental feature<experimental-features-term>`
in Mirantis OpenStack 6.0.

See:

- :ref:`provision-method-ug` gives instructions
  for implementing provisioning with the Fuel Agent
  when configuring your environment.

- :ref:`fuel-agent-arch` gives details about how
  the Fuel Agent provisions the OpenStack environment.
