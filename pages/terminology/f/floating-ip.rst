Floating IP address
-------------------

A floating IP address is an IP address, usually public,
that is dynamically associated with a running virtual instance
to make the VM accessible to the outside world.
Note that external ports are associated with tenant routers,
not with virtual instances.

To associate a floating IP address with your VM:

#. Add a floating IP address to the VM using either the
   `Horizon dashboard
   <http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/section_l3_router_and_nat.html>`_
   or the `command line
   <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/manage_ip_addresses.html>`_.

#. Configure the :ref:`Security Group<security-groups-term>`
   to enable the kind of access required for the VM.
   See `Configure access and security
   <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/Launching_Instances_using_Dashboard.html>`_
   for instances.

#. Select the appropriate rule for ICMP and SSH access;
   preconfigured rules are available from a drop-down menu
   inside the Security Group configuration dialogue.

#. If you want to connect to the instance using SSH,
   set up one of the following mechanisms:

   - Use a specific password-enabled image or cloud-init scripts.
   - Inject your public key into the instance.
     Instructions are in the document referenced in Step #3.
