Glance
------
Glance is the OpenStack Image Storage project.
Glance provides a scaleable, RESTful API for VM images and metadata.

Fuel can deploy either of the following
as the storage backend for Glance:

 * :ref:`Swift<swift-object-storage-term>`, the standard
   OpenStack object storage component

 * :ref:`Ceph RBD<ceph-term>`,
   the distributed block device provided by the Ceph storage platform.

 * In multi-node mode, Glance uses local file storage instead of Swift
   when configured with the default option
   (in other words, if Ceph is not enabled as the storage backend).

Glance can only be deployed on controller nodes in Fuel.

For more information, see the
`Glance developer documentation
<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/glance/>`_.
