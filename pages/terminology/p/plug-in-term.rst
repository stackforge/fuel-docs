Plugin
------

Beginning with Mirantis OpenStack 6.0,
Fuel features the ability to install plugins before you deploy your environment.
Plugins are downloadable software components that extend the functionality of your
environments in a flexible, repeatable, and reliable manner.

For example,
`Neutron VPNaaS <https://www.mirantis.com/products/openstack-drivers-and-plugins/fuel-plugins/#vpnaas>`_
provides flexible IPSec VPN feature-set supported by Neutron CLI and,
more simply, in Horizon, by adding a new set of tabs to Network. 

You can download Fuel plugins, read
the documentation and perform required
installation steps using
`Fuel Plugins Catalog <https://www.mirantis.com/products/openstack-drivers-and-plugins/fuel-plugins/>`_.
For common instructions on installation,
see :ref:`Install Fuel Plugins <install-plugin>`.

If you would like to develop
you own plugin for Fuel, enter
`Fuel Plugins SDK <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins>`_.

Note, that Mirantis provides
Fuel Plugins Validation -
a set of technical and business
processes that Mirantis uses
to verify Fuel plugins built by vendors,
allowing customer choice of plugins to lead to a predictable outcome.
That means, Mirantis Validation ensures the quality of developed solution.

In terms of Validation, Fuel plugins fall into two categories:

* *Validated* -  thoroughly reviewed, tested and supported by Mirantis.

* *Non-Validated* - reviewed, tested in terms of code and installation procedure,
  but not supported by Mirantis.

See the validation requirements at
`Fuel Plugin Validation <https://www.mirantis.com/partners/become-mirantis-unlocked-partner/fuel-plugin-development/fuel-plugin-validation/>`_ page.
