Plug-in
-------

Plug-in is a software component that adds a specific
feature to an existing software application.
That means, a kind of customization is provided.

In terms of Fuel, plug-ins provide additional functionality that helps to
extend the cloud usage.

According to the functionality, plug-ins can be Compute, Network, Storage and Operations.

For example, a Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) plug-in for Network allows you to add network load balancing to your cloud so that incoming traffic can be spread across multiple nodes.


Mirantis provides certification procedure to check if a plug-in
meets a set of requirements.
That means, Certified are those plug-ins that are thoroughly reviewed and tested by Mirantis.
Non-Certified are verified to check if they can be installed and configured without
failures.

Mirantis keeps both plug-in categories at a special web page.
You can download the required plug-in, install it and configure.
