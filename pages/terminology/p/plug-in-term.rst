Plug-in
-------

Fuel 6.0 supports Pluggable Architecture.
That means, any Mirantis or third-party developer
can create a plug-in for Fuel.

You can download enabled plug-ins from Mirantis web page.

All plug-ins fall into two categories: *Verified* and *External*.
*Verified* are those plug-ins that were properly tested for integration
with Fuel. Currently, GlusterFS and Neutron LBaaS are enabled.

*External* plug-ins are created by Mirantis or third-party developers.
If third-party developer sends a request
for plug-in verification, and Fuel-core team makes sure it is compatible
with Fuel infrastructure and does not break anything, then it are
regarded as Verified and signed with Fuel-core certificate.

Source code for existing Fuel plug-ins can be kept in any repository.
