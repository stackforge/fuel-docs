Multiple Cluster Networks (MCN)
-------------------------------

Multiple Cluster Networks (MCNs) are used for environments
that deploy a large number of target :ref:`nodes<node-term>`,
to avoid the broadcast storms that can occur
when all nodes share a single L2 domain.
Multiple Cluster networks can be configured
for OpenStack environments that use an encapsulation protocol
such as :ref:`Neutron GRE<neutron-gre-ovs-arch>`
and are deployed using Fuel 6.0 and later.
