The ML2 (Modular Layer 2) plug-in
is a framework that allows OpenStack Neutron networking
to simultaneously utilize a variety of Layer 2 networking technologies.
Fuel 5.1 and later releases support ML2 drivers.

For more information, see:

- :ref:`ml2-create-ops` gives instructions for implementing
  an ML2 driver.

- Richard Boswell's `article <http://www.revolutionlabs.net/2013/11/part-2-how-to-install-openstack-havana_15.html>`_
  includes a detailed example of implementing an ML2 driver;
  look for the "ML2 Configuration" section about half-way through the article.

- `Neutron/ML2 Wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/ML2>`_
  gives an overview of ML2.
