SR-IOV
------------------------------------
SR-IOV stands for "Single Root I/O Virtualization". It is a specification that allows a PCI device to appear virtually in multiple virtual machines (VM), each VM will have its own physical device.
The specification defines virtual functions (VFs) for the VMs and a physical function for the hypervisor. The usage of SR-IOV within the cloud allows you to reach to higher performance as the traffic bypass the TCP/IP stack in the kernel.
