Bonding
-------

NIC Bonding (also called NIC Aggregation)
allows you to aggregate multiple physical links to one link
to increase speed and provide fault tolerance.

Bonding is supported in the following modes:
Active-backup, Balance SLB (Source Level Bonding),
and Balance TCP with LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol).

The Fuel UI prevents you from configuring Bonding TCP by itself, without LACP.
