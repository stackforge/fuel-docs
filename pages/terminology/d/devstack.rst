DevStack
--------
An OpenStack package that can be installed and deployed on your laptop
or inside a VM on a cloud or other machine for evaluation purposes.
DevStack runs in a virtual machine so does not give the same performance
as OpenStack running on dedicated hardware
and it only runs a single node.
See the `DevStack web page <http://devstack.org/>`_
for installation instructions.

Fuel is a more powerful tool that supports a virtualized deployment
including multiple controllers and support for HA.
Fuel can also be used to deploy a bare-metal cloud
installed on bare metal and appropriate for a production environment.
