Murano
------
Project that enables OpenStack to run on a Windows virtual machine.
It supports Availability Zones, Disaster Recovery scenarios,
and uses native Microsoft Windows features to provide HA solutions.
See the `Murano wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Murano>`_.

Fuel can deploy a Dashboard, the Murano API,
the Conductor orchestration engine, and a Metadata Repository
on top of the Windows components that the customer
installs and deploys natively without using Fuel.
See `Murano Deployment Notes <http://docs.mirantis.com/fuel/fuel-4.1/user-guide.html#murano-deployment-notes>`_
for more information about deploying Murano with Fuel.
