Telemetry Services
------------------

The OpenStack Telemetry service
aggregates usage and performance data
across the services deployed in an OpenStack cloud.
This powerful capability provides visibility and insight
into the usage of the cloud across dozens of data points
and allows cloud operators to view metrics globally
or by individual deployed resources.
