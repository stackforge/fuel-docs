Note that when you have deployed your Neutron with NSX plugin
environment and logged into the Horizon dashboard,
you should create external and internal networks with
*net04_ext* and *net_04* names accordingly.

For more information on configuring networks,
see the blog post 
`Create virtual networks and launch a VM instance in OpenStack <https://www.edge-cloud.net/2014/01/openstack-vsphere-nsx-part5/>`_.
