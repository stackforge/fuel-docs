You have the following options:

- **Send usage statistics** collects and sends
  anonymous usage statistics such as settings, actions,
  hardware configuration, and version information.
  The usage statistics are completely anonymous
  and do not include information such as passwords,
  IP addresses, or node names.
  Uncheck this box to disable the collection of usage statistics.

- **Identify my error reports** authorizes Mirantis
  to associate error reports generated for your environment
  so that Mirantis Support staff can assist you.

.. note:: The Community version of Mirantis OpenStack
          has a different version of this screen
          that does not include the "Identify my error reports" section.

If you do not have a Mirantis account yet, click **Create Account**
