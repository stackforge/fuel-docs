Five network topologies are supported;
see :ref:`net-topology-plan`.

With the Neutron network selected, the jumbo frames feature
will be automatically enabled during the deployment process.
The jumbo frames parameters will be based on the MTU value of the
node's private network interface.

You can choose any of the Neutron topologies on this screen.
If you choose Legacy Networking (nova-network) here,
you can choose between the FlatDHCP and VLAN topologies
on the Network Settings page.
