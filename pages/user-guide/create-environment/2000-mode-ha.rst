High-availability (HA) or non-HA mode
-------------------------------------

Choose between these two modes,
which are described on the screen
when they are selected:

- **Multi-node with HA** -- Deploys an OpenStack environment
  that is ready for :ref:`ha-term`.
  Three Controller nodes must be configured
  for the environment to be considered HA
  but you can deploy a single-controller node in this mode
  and :ref:`add controllers<add-controller-ops>`
  at a later time
  to implement High Availability.

- **Multi-node** -- Deploys an OpenStack environment that
  is not managed by an HA stack such as Pacemaker.
  You cannot add more controllers in this mode
  without redeploying the environment in HA  mode.

All new deployments should use the "Multi-node with HA" mode.
The "Multi-node" mode is retained for
backward compatibility
but is expected to be deprecated in an upcoming release.
