This is your last chance to change the configuration;
check it carefully and,
if this is not the configuration you want to deploy, click "Cancel".
If this is the configuration you want,
click "Deploy";
after this, you cannot modify the configuration without starting over.

It can take fifteen minutes to an hour to deploy Mirantis OpenStack,
depending on the options chosen;
deployment times out at two hours.
You can monitor the progress by opening the **Nodes** tab
or by checking individual node logs in the **Logs** tab.
