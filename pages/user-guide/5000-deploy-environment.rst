Deploy Changes
==============

When you have made all the configuration changes you want to make,
click the "Deploy Changes" button
to deploy the environment you have defined.

It can take fifteen minutes to an hour to deploy Mirantis OpenStack,
depending on the options chosen;
deployment times out at two hours.
You can monitor the progress by opening the **Nodes** tab
or by checking individual node logs in the **Logs** tab.
