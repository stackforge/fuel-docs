.. _initialize-fuel:

Initialize Fuel
===============

After Fuel is installed,
point your browser to the default Fuel UI
URL: `http://10.20.0.2:8000 <http://10.20.0.2:8000>`__
or to the IP address and port number that you specified.

The following screen appears:

   :width: 50%

Boot settings (optional)
------------------------

If you need to modify the boot settings,
press the "Tab" key to display the **grub** command line;
you can edit this line to modify the boot settings
for the Fuel Master Node.
Normally this is not necessary.

.. _create-env-ug:

Create a new environment
========================

In the Fuel UI, click on the "New OpenStack environment" icon
to launch the wizard that is creates a new OpenStack environment.

.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/name_environ.png

Give the environment a name
and select the Linux distribution from the drop-down list.
This is the operating system that will be installed
on the Controller, Compute, and Storage nodes in the environment.

.. _mode-ha-ug:

High-availability (HA) or non-HA mode
-------------------------------------


.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/choose_deploy_mode.png
   :width: 50%

All new deployments should use the Multi-node HA mode.
Beginning with Mirantis OpenStack 5.0,
HA mode can be deployed with a single Controller node
plus a compute node;
you will need to add additional Controller nodes
to achieve high-availability
(which is strongly recommended for production environments),
but you do not need to redeploy the OpenStack environment
to implement high-availability.

The multi-node mode without HA is supported
for backward compatibility
but will be deprecated in a later release.

- If you select "Default",
  then the Local Volumes over iSCSI are used as the backend for Cinder.
- If you select "Ceph",
  you must assign at least two nodes as Ceph-OSD nodes.

Select the storage backend for :ref:`glance-term`:

- If you select "Default" and are using the Multi-node HA mode,
  Swift is used as a backend for Cinder
  and is automatically installed on the Controller nodes.
- If you select "Default" and are using the Multi-node (no HA) mode,
  local storage is used as the backed for Glance.
- If you selected Ceph,
  you must assign the Ceph-OSD role on at least two nodes.

Verify Networks
---------------

When you have applied all your information to the "Network Settings" screen,
click the "Verify Networks" button at the bottom of the screen.
This checks and confirms the network configuration

The network check includes tests for connectivity between
nodes via configured VLANs on configured host interfaces.
Additionally, checks for an unexpected DHCP server are done
to ensure that outside DHCP servers will not interfere with deployment.
The image below shows a sample result of the check.
If there are errors, it is either in your configuration of interfaces
or possibly the VLAN tagging feature is disabled on your switch port.

.. _vlan-splinters-ug:

VLAN splinters
++++++++++++++

VLAN splinters are provided so that CentOS deployments
can support Neutron VLANS or GRE
(with VLAN tags on the management, storage, or public networks).
The kernel used for the CentOS version used with OpenStack
is based on a pre-3.3 kernel
and so has poor support for VLAN tagged packets
moving through :ref:`ovs-term` bridges.
Without VLAN splinters,
CentOS deployments may experience poor performance issues,
intermittent connectivity problems,
situations where one VLAN is working but others are not,
or a total failure to pass traffic.
Ubuntu deployments use a kernel that includes strong VLAN support
and so are not affected by these issues.


.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/settings-vlan-splinters.png
   :width: 50%

You can select either the soft trunks or hard trunks mode:

*  The **soft trunks mode** configures OVS to enable splinters
   and attempts to automatically detect in-use VLANs.
   This provides the least amount of performance overhead
   but the traffic may not be passed onto the OVS bridge in some edge cases.

*  The **hard trunks mode** also configures OVS to enable splinters
   but uses an explicitly defined list of all VLANs across all interfaces.
   This should prevent the occasional failures associated with the soft mode
   but requires that corresponding tags be created on all of the interfaces.
   This introduces additional performance overhead.
   You should use fewer than 50 VLANs
   if you run the Neutron VLAN mode and use the hard trunks mode.

It can take fifteen minutes to an hour to deploy Mirantis OpenStack,
depending on the options chosen;
deployment times out at two hours.
You can monitor the progress by opening the **Nodes** tab
or by checking individual node logs in the **Logs** tab.
