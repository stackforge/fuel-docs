Download and Install Fuel
=========================

Mirantis provides the images you will use to
install Fuel and Mirantis OpenStack.
Download the Fuel image from the
`Mirantis web-site <http://software.mirantis.com/>`_.
Depending on the speed of your Internet connection,
this could take a half hour or more.

.. _create-media-ug:

Create the Installation Media
-----------------------------
You can download an ISO file and,
for many modern servers,
use a remote control utility such as
`ipmitool <http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipmitool/>`_,
HP iLO, or Dell iDRAC
to mount the ISO image directly
to the server's virtual DVD drive.

For a bare-metal installation,
you can instead burn the ISO image to a DVD or
burn the IMG file to a USB drive,
then use that media to install the software.

.. note:: You can use the same ISO image
   to install Fuel and Mirantis OpenStack
   in VirtualBox.
   In that case, copy the ISO file to the approriate directory
   and boot directly from that disk file.
   See the `Quick Start Guide <http://software.mirantis.com/quick-start/>`_.
   and :ref:`virtualbox-top`.


Use any standard software to burn the ISO to a writeable DVD.
Some popular options:

- **Linux** --
  `Brasero` and `Xfburn` are commonly pre-installed applications

- **Mac OS X** --
  Open `Disk Utility` from `Applications > Utilities`,
  drag the ISO into the disk list on the left side of the window and select it,
  insert a blank DVD, and click `Burn`.
  If you prefer a different utility,
  check out the open source
  `Burn <http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html>`_.

- **Windows** -- 
  Use `ImgBurn <http://www.imgburn.com/>`_ or the
  open source `InfraRecorder <http://infrarecorder.org/>`_

Install Fuel Master Node
------------------------

Insert (or mount through IPMI) the media
you created in :ref:`download-install-ug`
on the server that will be your Fuel Master Node
and power the machine on,
just as you would for any operating system installation.
Set the boot order for the system
with the installation media as the first device.
Or you can set the hard drive as the first device,
then select the location of the media that contains
the installation file to install the software.
The following screen appears.

   :width: 50%

If necessary, you can modify the boot settings from this screen;
press the "Tab" key to display the **grub** command line
and edit that line.
This allows you to configure the IP address,
default gateway, and DNS server for the Fuel Master Node.

Additionally, checks for an unexpected DHCP server are done
to ensure that outside DHCP servers will not interfere with deployment.
The image below shows a sample result of the check.
If there are errors, it is either in your configuration of interfaces
or possibly the VLAN tagging feature is disabled on your switch port.

.. _vlan-splinters-ug:

VLAN splinters
++++++++++++++

VLAN splinters are provided so that CentOS deployments
can support Neutron VLANS or GRE
(with VLAN tags on the management, storage, or public networks).
The kernel used for the CentOS version used with OpenStack
is based on a pre-3.3 kernel
and so has poor support for VLAN tagged packets
moving through :ref:`ovs-term` bridges.
Without VLAN splinters,
CentOS deployments may experience poor performance issues,
intermittent connectivity problems,
situations where one VLAN is working but others are not,
or a total failure to pass traffic.
Ubuntu deployments use a kernel that includes strong VLAN support
and so are not affected by these issues.


.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/settings-vlan-splinters.png
   :width: 50%

You can select either the soft trunks or hard trunks mode:

*  The **soft trunks mode** configures OVS to enable splinters
   and attempts to automatically detect in-use VLANs.
   This provides the least amount of performance overhead
   but the traffic may not be passed onto the OVS bridge in some edge cases.

*  The **hard trunks mode** also configures OVS to enable splinters
   but uses an explicitly defined list of all VLANs across all interfaces.
   This should prevent the occasional failures associated with the soft mode
   but requires that corresponding tags be created on all of the interfaces.
   This introduces additional performance overhead.
   You should use fewer than 50 VLANs
   if you run the Neutron VLAN mode and use the hard trunks mode.
