When this option is selected, :ref:`ephemeral volumes<ephemeral-storage-term>`
will be created as a copy-on-write layer of the base image.
Without this option selected, ephemeral volumes will be full
copies of the base image. The default setting is to use
copy-on-write for ephemeral volumes. This option has no effect
when using :ref:`Ceph<ceph-term>` for ephemeral storage.
