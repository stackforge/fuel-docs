Choose image format

Choose whether to use the qcow2 image format for saved images.

This selects the image format used for :ref:`Glance<glance-term>`
and :ref:`ephemeral volumes<ephemeral-storage-term>`.
The default setting is to use
the qcow (actually :ref:`qcow2<qcow2-term>`) format,
which is recommended when using :ref:`Swift<swift-object-storage-term>`
as the storage backend for Glance.
If you use :ref:`Ceph RBD<ceph-term>`
for Glance image storage or for ephemeral volumes,
you should disable the qcow image format
so that the raw format is used.
