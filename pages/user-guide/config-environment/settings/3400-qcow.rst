If you are using :ref:`Swift<swift-object-storage-term>`
as the storage backend for :ref:`glance-term`,
use the qcow format.
If you are using :ref:`Ceph<ceph-term>`,
disable qcow formatting.
This causes the system to store images in raw format.
If you use qcow2 format with Ceph,
images must be converted to raw format
in order to be cloned.
Ceph includes its own mechanisms that provide
copy-on-write capability and snapshots,
which the qcow2 format provides for Swift images.
