If you are using :ref:`LVM<lvm-term>`
as the storage backend for :ref:`Cinder<cinder-term>`,
choose the qcow (actually qcow2) format.
If you are using :ref:`Ceph RBD<ceph-term>`
as the storage backend for Cinder
and :ref:`ephemeral volumes<ephemeral-storage-term>`,
disable qcow formatting.
This causes the system to store images in raw format.
If you use qcow2 format with Ceph,
images must be converted to raw format
in order to be cloned.
Ceph includes its own mechanisms that provide
copy-on-write capability and snapshots,
which the qcow2 format provides for Nova.
