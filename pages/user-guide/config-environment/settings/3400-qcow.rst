This selects the image format used for :ref:`Cinder<cinder-term>`
and :ref:`ephemeral volumes<ephemeral-storage-term>`.
The default setting is to use the qcow (actually qcow2) format.
If you use :ref:`Ceph RBD<ceph-term>`
for Cinder volume storage or for ephemeral volumes,
disable the qcow image format;
this causes the system to store images in raw format.

The qcow2 format provides copy-on-write and snapshots
for Nova when :ref:`LVM<lvm-term>` is used
as the storage backend for Cinder.
Ceph includes its own mechanisms that provide
copy-on-write capability and snapshots;
if you use the qcow2 image format with Ceph,
images must be converted to raw format
in order to be cloned.
