The Filter :ref:`scheduler-term`
uses a set of filters plus a weighting algorithm
to determine the best Compute Node on which to deploy
a new VM instance.
The Filter Scheduler is generally superior to the older scheduler
and should be used for most environments;
use this screen to choose the older scheduler if necessary.
