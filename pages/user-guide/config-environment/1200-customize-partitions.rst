To get to this screen:

- Click on the gear wheel at the right end of
  the node listing under the "Nodes" tab.
  This displays the basic hardware specs for the node.
- Click on the "Configure Disks" button.

Note the following:

- Disk partitions can be customized
  only after a role is assigned to the node.
- If you have multiple nodes that have identical hardware
  and identical roles,
  you can partition all their disks at the same time
  by selecting them all and then clicking the "Configure Disks" button.
