Deploying vCenter
-------------------

.. contents :local:

:ref:`vcenter-plan` discusses actions and decisions
that should be made before attempting to deploy
Mirantis OpenStack with vSphere integration.

Note, that before following the instructions
below you should make sure that:

* vCenter is accessible.

* the login and the password are correct.


To deploy an OpenStack cloud that is integrated
with the vSphere environment,
click on the "New OpenStack environment" icon
to launch the wizard that creates a new OpenStack environment.


.. _vcenter-start-create-env-ug:

Create Environment and Choose Distribution for vCenter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Either the CentOS or Ubuntu distro
can be used as the host operating system on the Slave nodes
for environments that support integration with vSphere:

Select vCenter Hypervisor for vCenter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Beginning with Fuel 6.1, you can create a :ref:`dual hypervisor
environment <dualhyperv-arch>`.
That means, you now have three options:

#. enable vCenter only - select vCenter checkbox
   and leave the radio button as is; you will then
   finish this configuration using VMware tab of the Fuel web UI.
   See the :ref:`VMware tab<vmware-tab>` for more details.

   .. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/select-vcenter-kvm.png

#. enable both vCenter and KVM/QEMU - select vCenter checkbox
   and choose between KVM and QEMU radio buttons.

   .. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/select-vcenter-kvm.png

#. enable KVM/QEMU only - click the corresponding radio button
   and leave vCenter checkbox empty.

.. _vcenter-netv-service:

Select Network Service for vCenter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Currently, the only support network option for vCenter is nova-network.

.. _vcenter-backend:

Choose Backend for Cinder and Glance with vCenter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At this step you should select
storage backend for Cinder that
is going to be used with KVM/QEMU if you deploy compute nodes.
You can choose Ceph as the backend for Cinder and Glance
with vCenter.
If you would like to use Glance with VMware datastore,
enable it on the *Settings* tab of the Fuel web UI
and finish backend configuration at the VMware tab.

.. _ceilometer-related-projects:

Related projects for vCenter
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Nova-network does not support Murano,
so you cannot run Murano in the OpenStack environment
with vSphere integration.


.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/platform_services-vmware.png


Previously, when you selected vCenter,
Compute and Controller roles were assigned to the same node,
while Ceilometer compute agent was not present on this node.

In Fuel 6.1 release, this logic was changed to provide
metrics collection for the instances.

For previous Fuel releases,
support for collecting polling meters
from instances on vCenter was not implemented:
only central agent polled services like Glance and Swift on
Controller node. No metrics was collected from compute nodes.

In 6.1, Ceilometer support for vCenter is implemented according
to 1-1 mapping principle (the one done between :ref:`nova-compute and
vSphere cluster <1-1 mapping>`).
Now Ceilometer compute service is available
for each vSphere cluster. That means,every agent polls resources
about instances from those that only relate to their vSphere cluster.
Every agent uses its own configuration file with authentication
parameters for its specific vSphere cluster.
What is more, monitoring under Pacemaker is introduced
for every Ceilometer compute service to avoid failures
(for example, failover of primary controller node)
and missing polling data as the result.

Select *Create* and click on the icon for your named environment.


Configuring a vCenter environment
---------------------------------

Select your OpenStack environment integrated with vSphere to display
the configuration screen. Set up the environment proceeding with the
following steps.


.. _assign-roles-vcenter-ug:

Assign a role to a node server
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Procedure:**

#. In the configuration screen, select the `Nodes` tab.
#. Assign a role to the node server by checking the required option from
   the available options list:

   .. list-table:: **Node roles for the OpenStack environments that support vCenter**
      :widths: 10 30
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Role
        - Description

      * - **Controller**
        - Controller node initiates orchestration activities and provides
          an external API. Fuel installs components such as Glance, Keystone,
          Horizon, and Nova-Scheduler on Controller node as well.

          | By default, for VMware vCenter integration, a nova-compute service
            with VCDriver runs on Controller node.
            The nova-compute service on Controller node manages VMs running
            on ESXi hosts through vCenter.

      * - **Compute**
        - Compute node creates, manages, and terminates VMs.
          The nova-compute service on Compute node manages locally running
          VMs through KVM/QEMU.

      * - **Storage - Cinder**
        - Cinder node provides scheduling of block storage resources,
          typically delivered over iSCSI or other compatible backend
          storage systems. You can use Block storage for database storage,
          expandable file systems, or to provide a server with access
          to raw block level devices. This node role can be enabled for
          the Cinder with LVM or Ceph environment.

      * - **Storage - Cinder Proxy to VMware Datastore**
        - Cinder-VMware provides scheduling of block storage resources delivered
          over VMware vCenter.

      * - **Compute VMware**
        - Compute VMware node runs nova-compute with VCDriver that manages
          ESXI computing resources through VMware vCenter. It enables you to deploy
          a nova-compute service on a standalone node rather than Controller
          node.


Deploy nova-compute on a standalone node
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you need to distribute nova-compute services among available nodes
and deploy nova-compute on a standalone node, proceed with the
following steps.

**Procedure**:

#. Assign a *Compute VMware* role to the node.

#. In the *VMware tab* for a specific cluster, select this node
   as the *Target node* for the ``nova-compute`` service.

.. note::

   Known limitations for the *Compute VMware* node role:

   * you cannot combine it with any other role;

   * you cannot add a Compute-VMware node to a deployed OpenStack environment.

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`nova_computes` configuration.
   * :ref:`vcenter-plan`


.. _network-settings-vcenter-ug:


Configure the Network
+++++++++++++++++++++

You should choose either the Nova-network FlatDHCP or the VLAN manager:

* VLAN manager provides better virtual machine isolation,
  i.e. enables segregating virtual machine tenants into separate broadcast domains.

* FlatDHCP manager uses a single IP subnet.
  Select it if you do not want to configure VLANs on your network equipment.

Please, note that nova-network will be working in a single-host mode (that
means, the process runs on one of the Controllers) if you are using vCenter.
When nova-network crashes it will be restarted by
:ref:`pacemaker<pacemaker-term>` on the same Controller or on another live
Controller, during this period of time, all virtual machines will lose
connectivity with external networks. Without vCenter, each compute node holds
its own nova-network process (multi-host mode).

For information on FlatDHCP and VLAN manager architecture,
see :ref:`Nova Network Topologies<nova-topologies-arch>`.

- To enable *FlatDHCP manager*, follow these steps:

  #. In the *Networks* tab, click the *FlatDHCP manager* radio button.

  #. In the *Nova-network configuration*, enable the *Use VLAN tagging
     for fixed networks* checkbox.

  #. Type the VLAN tag you selected for the VLAN ID in the ESXi host
     network configuration.

- To enable *VLAN manager*, follow these steps:

  #. In the *Networks* tab, select the *VLAN manager* radio button.

  #. In the *Nova-network configuration*, select *Fixed network size*
     using the drop-down menu.

  #. Specify *Number of fixed networks* and type *Fixed VLAN ID range*.

  #. Click the **Verify Networks** button to verify if networks are configured
     correctly.

  #. Click the **Save settings** button to continue.


.. _settings-tab:

Settings
++++++++

To enable VMware vCenter for volumes,
you should add a node and assign
*Storage - Cinder Proxy to VMware Datastore* role
to it, see
:ref:`assign-roles-vcenter-ug` for details.

To enable VMware vCenter managed datastore as a backend for Glance,
select *VMWare vCenter/ESXi datastore for images (Glance)* checkbox.

.. _vmware-tab:

VMware tab
++++++++++

Beginning with Fuel 6.1 release, all vCenter-related settings
are consolidated on the VMware tab of the Fuel web UI.


vCenter
^^^^^^^

In this section, you should enter not only vCenter credentials
(previously found on the Fuel UI wizard and *Settings* of the Fuel web UI
tab), but
also specify Availability zone:

* For KVM/QEMU nova-compute services, availability zone is *nova*.
  You cannot edit its name, because it is the default availability zone used by OpenStack.

* For vCenter nova-compute services, the availability zone name is set to *vcenter*
  by default, but it can be changed.

.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/vmware-tab-vcenter.png


.. _nova_computes:

Nova-Computes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each nova-compute service controls a single vSphere cluster.
For each vSphere cluster, you need to configure a separate nova-compute
service that will be running either on the Controller node,
or on a Compute-VMware host.

Select from the following options:

* for vCenter only environment - do not add any compute nodes.

* for dual hypervisors environments - configure the following:

  * **vSphere cluster** - specifies the name of the cluster that this nova-compute
    service manages.

  * **Service name** - specifies the service name to reference to your cluster.
    It is a string that should not contain any non-ASCII characters.

  * **Datastore regexp** - indicates datastores to use with Compute.
    For example, if you select `openstack-.*`, all datastores that have
    a name starting with `openstack-` are chosen.

    If you plan to use all available datastores, leave the field blank.
    In this case, nova-compute service will pick the first datastore returned by
    the vSphere API.

    .. seealso::

       * `VMware vSphere <http://docs.openstack.org/juno/config-reference/content/vmware.html>`_

  * **Target node** - a dropdown list with the following items:

    * the *controllers* option is selected by default.
      It deploys the nova-compute service on the Controller nodes.

    * names of all nodes with the compute-vmware role assigned.
      Select one of the available nodes if you decide to run
      the compute-service on that standalone node.

    .. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/vmware-tab-nova-computes.png

If required, configure more nova-compute instances by clicking *+*.


Network
^^^^^^^

If you decided to use VLAN Manager,
enter the interface of ESXi hosts on which VLANs will be provisioned.

.. image:: /_images/user_screen_shots/vmware-tab-vlan.png



Glance
^^^^^^

To enable Glance, you should first select the checkbox on the *Settings* tab
(see :ref:`VMware vCenter/ESXi datastore for images (Glance) <settings-tab>`).
Then, you should enter the information for Glance.
