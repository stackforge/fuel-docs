Benefits
--------

* Using post-deployment checks helps you identify potential issues which
  may impact the health of a deployed system.

* All post-deployment checks provide detailed descriptions about failed
  operations and tell you which component or components are not working
  properly.

* Performing these checks manually would consumed a great deal of time,
  but it only take a few minutes to run the full suite of tests
  from the Fuel console.

* Aside from verifying that everything is working correctly,
  the process also determines how quickly your system works.

* Post-deployment checks continue to be useful
  after you initially deploy your environment.
  For example, after sizable changes are made in the environment,
  you can use the checks to determine
  if any new failure points have been introduced.
