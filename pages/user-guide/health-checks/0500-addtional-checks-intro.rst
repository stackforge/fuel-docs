Additional Checks
-----------------
If you have installed OpenStack to use a High Availability (HA) architecture
or have installed related OpenStack projects like Savanna or Murano,
additional tests will be shown. The following are the tests available
in HA mode:

* Check data replication over mysql
* Check amount of tables in os databases is the same on each node
* Check mysql environment state

Savanna, Murano, and Heat tests are included in Platform Tests
and are described in the sections that discuss those services.
