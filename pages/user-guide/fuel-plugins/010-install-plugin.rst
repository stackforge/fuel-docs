Install Fuel plugins
====================

Overview
--------

Beginning with Mirantis OpenStack 6.0,
Fuel features the ability to install plugins before you deploy your environment.
Plugins are downloadable software components that extend the functionality of your
environments in a flexible, repeatable and reliable manner.

For example,
`Neutron LBaaS <https://software.mirantis.com/download-mirantis-openstack-fuel-plug-ins/#lbaas>`_
provides Load-Balancing-as-a-Service for Neutron, OpenStack Network Service.

Certification
-------------

The Fuel Plugins Certification is
a set of technical and business
processes that Mirantis uses
to verify Fuel plugins built by vendors,
allowing customer choice of plugins to lead to a predictable outcome.
That means, Mirantis Certification ensures the quality of developed solution.

In terms of Certification, Fuel plugins fall into two categories:

* *Certified* -  thoroughly reviewed, tested and supported by Mirantis.

* *Non-Certified* - reviewed, tested in terms of code and installation procedure,
  but not supported by Mirantis.


See the certification requirements at
`Mirantis website <https://www.mirantis.com/partners/become-mirantis-technology-partner/fuel-plugin-development/fuel-plugin-certification/>`_.

For information on development requirements
and FAQ, see
`Fuel Plugins <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins>`_ wiki page.


Installation steps
------------------

Installation procedure is common for all plugins, but their requirements differ.

#. Download a plugin from
   `Fuel Plugins Catalog <https://software.mirantis.com/download-mirantis-openstack-fuel-plug-ins/>`_.

#. Get acquainted with the plugin documentation to learn about
   prerequisites and limitations.

#. Copy the plugin on already installed Fuel Master node.
   If you do not have the Fuel Master node yet, see `Mirantis Quick Start Guide <https://software.mirantis.com/quick-start/>`_.

   ::

         scp <fuel_plugin-file> root@:<the_Fuel_Master_node_IP>:/tmp

#. Log into the Fuel Master node and install the plugin:

   ::

         cd /tmp
         fuel plugins --install <fuel-plugin-file>

#. After your environment is created, open *Settings* tab on the
   Fuel web UI, scroll down the page and select the plugin checkbox.
   Finish environment configuration and click *Deploy* button.

For Fuel plugins CLI reference, see :ref:`the corresponding section <fuel-plugins-cli>`.


Virtual IP reservation via Fuel Plugin's metadata
-------------------------------------------------

Some plugins require an additional VIP for a proper configuration.
Previously, VIPs reservation was based on networks' metadata.
Now, it is based on network roles' description. Thus, a plugin developer
has a better way to create extra VIPs as a puppet resource in the
pre-deployment or post-deployment stage.

First, a user should define VIPs in plugin's metadata and install
a plugin before creating an environment.

.. note::
   The last limitation will be solved in 7.0.

Such reserved addresses can be later used in puppet manifests
inside other plugin tasks.

For example, Zabbix can be configured in a way that it receives
SNMP traffic on dedicated VIP. In that case, a plugin developer
can define extra VIPs in a plugin configuration file and use
it as a puppetâ€™s resource.

VIP reservation is possible only via plugin metadata. This is done
by adding a new file ``network_roles.yaml``.

Network roles configuration file format looks like:

 .. code-block:: yaml

    - id: "name_of_network_role"
      default_mapping: "public"
      properties:
        subnet: true
        gateway: false
        vip:
          - name: "testvip_a"
            alias: "alias_name"
            namespace: "haproxy"
            node_roles: ["primary-controller", "controller"]
          - name: "testvip_b"

 .. note::

    ``alias``, ``namespace``, and ``node_roles`` parameters are optional.

    ``name`` - a string that contains a unique name within
    the environment;

    ``namespace`` - a string that points to a network namespace
    to be used for landing of the VIP, null if not defined;

    ``node_roles`` - a list of node roles where VIPs should be set up.
    If not defined, its value will be set to ["primary-controller", "controller"].


In the above example, a new network role is described as that contains 2 VIPs
(with names ``testvip_a`` and ``testvip_b``).
So, the whole workflow should look like this:

#. A plugin developer adds ``network_roles.yaml`` to the plugin.
#. The plugin is compiled and installed on the Fuel master node.

   .. note::

      The package version 3.0.0 is required.

#. A cluster is created with plugin enabled.
   Once configured the deployment begins.
#. After deployment process starts, Nailgun allocates VIPs for each network role
   and sends VIPs and other metadata to astute.
#. During deployment, VIPs are available in puppet manifests inside the structure
   network_metadata['vips'] via Hiera.

For example:

.. code-block:: puppet

 class vip_example::primary_controller {
  $vip_name = 'my_vip_a'
  $vip_nic = hiera('public_int', undef)

  $network_meta = hiera('network_metadata')
  $vip_addr = $network_meta['vips'][$vip_name]['ipaddr']

  cs_resource { $vip_name:
    ensure          => present,
    primitive_class => 'ocf',
    provided_by     => 'heartbeat',
    primitive_type  => 'IPaddr2',
    parameters      => {
      'nic'                  => $vip_nic,
      'ip'                   => $vip_addr,
    },
    metadata => {
      'migration-threshold' => '3',   # will be try start 3 times before migrate to another node
      'failure-timeout'     => '60',  # forget any fails of starts after this timeout
      'resource-stickiness' => '1'
    },
  }

  service { $vip_name:
    ensure   => 'running',
    enable   => true,
    provider => 'pacemaker',
  }

  Cs_resource[$vip_name] -> Service[$vip_name]

 }
