Install Fuel plugins
====================

Overview
--------

Beginning with Mirantis OpenStack 6.0,
Fuel features the ability to install plugins before you deploy your environment.
Plugins are downloadable software components that extend the functionality of your
environments in a flexible, repeatable and reliable manner.

For example,
`Neutron VPNaaS <https://www.mirantis.com/products/openstack-drivers-and-plugins/fuel-plugins/#vpnaa
s>`_
provides flexible IPSec VPN feature-set supported by Neutron CLI and,
more simply, in Horizon, by adding a new set of tabs to Network. 

Validation
----------

The Fuel Plugins Validation is a set of technical and business
processes that Mirantis uses to verify Fuel plugins built by vendors,
allowing a customer's choice of plugins to lead to a predictable outcome.
That means, Mirantis Validation ensures the quality of developed solution.

In terms of Validation, Fuel plugins fall into two categories:

* *Validated* -  thoroughly reviewed, tested and supported by Mirantis.

* *Non-Validated* - reviewed, tested in terms of code and installation procedure,
  but not supported by Mirantis.


See the validation requirements at
`Mirantis website <https://www.mirantis.com/partners/become-mirantis-unlocked-partner/fuel-plugin-development/fuel-plugin-validation/>`_.

For information on development requirements and FAQ, see
`Fuel Plugins <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins>`_ wiki page.
