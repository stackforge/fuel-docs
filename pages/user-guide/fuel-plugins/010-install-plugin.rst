Install Fuel plugins
====================

Overview
--------

Beginning with Mirantis OpenStack 6.0,
Fuel features the ability to install plugins before you deploy your environment.
Plugins are downloadable software components that extend the functionality of your
environments in a flexible, repeatable and reliable manner.

For example,
`Neutron LBaaS <https://software.mirantis.com/download-mirantis-openstack-fuel-plug-ins/#lbaas>`_
provides Load-Balancing-as-a-Service for Neutron, OpenStack Network Service.

Certification
-------------

The Fuel Plugins Certification is
a set of technical and business
processes that Mirantis uses
to verify Fuel plugins built by vendors,
allowing customer choice of plugins to lead to a predictable outcome.
That means, Mirantis Certification ensures the quality of developed solution.

In terms of Certification, Fuel plugins fall into two categories:

* *Certified* -  thoroughly reviewed, tested and supported by Mirantis.

* *Non-Certified* - reviewed, tested in terms of code and installation procedure,
  but not supported by Mirantis.


See the certification requirements at
`Mirantis website <https://www.mirantis.com/partners/become-mirantis-technology-partner/fuel-plugin-development/fuel-plugin-certification/>`_.

For information on development requirements
and FAQ, see
`Fuel Plugins <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins>`_ wiki page.


Installation steps
