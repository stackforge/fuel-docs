Introduction to the User Guide
==============================

This guide gives instructions for using
the Fuel Master Node and the graphical Fuel screens
to deploy a Mirantis OpenStack environment.

If you already have a deployed Fuel Master Node based on v5.x,
go to :ref:`upgrade-patch-top-ug` for instructions about
upgrading to Fuel 5.1
and updating your existing OpenStack distribution
to use the latest maintenance release of Mirantis OpenStack.
If you are deploying Mirantis OpenStack 5.x for the first time,
continue reading this document for instructions.

Before you do the procedures in this document,
you should work through the information and procedures in the
:ref:`Planning Guide<planning-guide>`.
That document discusses the planning decisions
required before you install and deploy Mirantis OpenStack.

Further reading is available in the following documents:

- :ref:`Terminology Reference<Terminology-ref>` is an alphabetical listing
  of technologies and concepts
  that serves as both a glossary and a master index
  of information in the Mirantis docs and other sources of information.
- :ref:`Operations Guide<operations-guide>` gives information about advanced tasks
  required to maintain the OpenStack environment after it is deployed.
  Most of these tasks are done in the shell
  using text editors and command line tools.
- :ref:`Reference Architecture<ref-arch>` provides background information
  about how OpenStack works.

For community members and partners looking to take Fuel even further,
see the `developer documentation <http://docs.mirantis.com/fuel-dev/develop.html>`_
for information about the internal architecture of Fuel,
instructions for building the project,
information about interacting with the REST API
and other topics of interest to more advanced developers.
You can also visit the `Fuel project <https://launchpad.net/fuel>`_
for more detailed information and become a contributor.
