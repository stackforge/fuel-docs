Introduction to the User Guide
==============================

This guide gives instructions for using
the Fuel Master node and the graphical Fuel screens
to deploy a Mirantis OpenStack environment.
It is the third part of a three-document set
with details to get you started with Mirantis OpenStack and Fuel.
Before you do the procedures in this document,
you should work through the information and procedures in:

- :ref:`Pre-install_Guide` discusses the planning decisions
  required before you install and deploy Mirantis OpenStack.
- :ref:`install-guide` gives instructions for configuring
  the physical servers and the networks that connect them
  and then how to download and install the Fuel Master node.

Other documents in the set provide addtional information:

- :ref:`terminology` is an alphabetical listing
  of technologies and concepts
  that serves as both a glossary and a master index
  to information in the Mirantis docs and other sources of information.
- :ref:`operations-guide` gives information about advanced tasks
  required to maintain the OpenStack environment after it is deployed.
  Most of these tasks are done in the shell
  using text editors and command line tools.
- :ref:`ref-arch` provides background information
  about how OpenStack works.

For community members and partners looking to take Fuel even further,
see the `developer documentation <http://docs.mirantis.com/fuel-dev/develop.html>`_
for information about the internal architecture of Fuel,
instructions for building the project,
information about interacting with the REST API
and other topics of interest to more advanced developers.
You can also visit the `Fuel project <https://launchpad.net/fuel>`_
