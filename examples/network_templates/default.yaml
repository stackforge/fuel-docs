adv_net_template:
# default - is the name of the node network group. If you have additional
# network groups, add descriptions with all parameters for all network group.
# If parameters of additional network groups are not described in this
# template, parameters of the default network groups apply.
  default:
    nic_mapping:
# NIC mapping for node in this network group. The default section will be
# used for all nodes unless they are specifically configured. You can specify
# mapping for every node.
      default:
# Add custom or remove aliases for network interfaces, such as eth0, and
# sub-interfaces (VLANs), such as eth0.101 to
# later use them in the transformation section.

        pub: eth1

        stor: eth3
    templates_for_node_role:
# Specify templates for each type of node (node role), such as controller,
# compute, storage, and so on. The order of templates
# is important. For example, if you create a bond in one template and later
# use it in the other template, you must place the template in which you
# created the bond before the other template, so that the bond is created
# before it is referenced in the other template.

    network_assignments:
# Specify an endpoint for each network, if you add addtional custom networks,
# add endpoints for these networks as well.
        storage:

        fuelweb_admin:
          ep: br-fw-admin
    network_scheme:
# Describe the network scheme for all node roles.
# - transformations - describe actions required to create a network.
#   For service networks, such as Storage, Management, and Admin,
#   create a Linux bridge. For workload networks that
#   communicated with the OpenStack Networking service, such as
#   Private and Public service, create an Open vSwitch (OVS),
#   a Linux Bridge, a patch that connects the OVS with the Linux
#   bridge, and a port.
#   Available commands:
#
#   * ``add-bridge`` - creates a bridge. By default, creates a Linux
#     bridge. You can specify the following parameters for this command:
#
#   * ``add-port`` - creates a port that connects a Linux bridge with a
#     physical network interface.
#
#   * ``add-patch`` - connects to network bridges. All networks that
#     serve traffic to the control plane must have a patch that connects
#     the OVS bridge and the Linux bridge.
#
#   * ``add-bond`` - add a network bonding for high workload networks to
#     increase performance.
#
#   For more information about the properties that you can specify, see
#   the Fuel User Guide: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/fuel-docs/.html.
#
# - endpoints - specify the list of logical endpoints for the networks
#   that you have defined in the network_assignments section.
#
# - roles - map network traffic (network roles) to logical endpoints in the
#   <type_of_traffic>: <endpoint> format. The list of network roles is
#   available in the nailgun/nailgun/fixtures/openstack.yaml file.
#   Do not repeat a type of traffic. Any type of traffic must be mentioned
#   in the whole node network group just once. Otherwise, a network
#   conflict may occur. The roles section cannot be empty. If you do not
#   want to specify any type of traffic, create a fake mapping. For example:
#     roles:
#       fake/ext: br-pub-ext
