.. container:: what-is-mirantis-openstack

  Mirantis OpenStack is made up of three components:

  * :ref:`hardened-packages-term`.
    Hardened packages in Mirantis OpenStack
    include the core OpenStack projects,
    updated with each stable release of OpenStack,
    and supporting a broad range of operating systems,
    hypervisors, and deployment topologies.

  * :ref:`fuel-term`.
    Fuel is an open source, software life cycle management application
    that deploys multiple `OpenStack <https://www.openstack.org/>`_
    environments from a single interface
    and then enables you to manage those environments post deployment.

  * `Support <https://software.mirantis.com/support-options/>`_.
    A complementary `30-day basic trial support subscription
    <https://software.mirantis.com/trial-support-subscription/>`_
    is available.
