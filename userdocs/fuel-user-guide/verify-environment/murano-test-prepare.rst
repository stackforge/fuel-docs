Preparing the OpenStack Application Catalog for testing
-------------------------------------------------------

Fuel runs the platform tests in the tenant you have previously
specified in the :menuselection:`Settings --> OpenStack Settings`.
By default, Fuel selects the *admin* tenant.

You must download and prepare a corresponding image to test Murano.
For example, for Linux-based services deployment testing,
add a Linux based image to Murano.

To prepare the OpenStack Application Catalog for testing,
add a Linux-based image to Murano. You can download the `pre-built
Murano image
<http://murano-files.mirantis.com/ubuntu_14_04-murano-agent_stable_juno.qcow2Â¬>`_
or build your own as described in  `Murano documentation
<http://murano.readthedocs.org/en/latest/image_builders/index.html>`_.

.. note::
       The base operating system of the Murano image does not have to
       match the base operating system of the OpenStack environment.

**Prepare the OpenStack Application Catalog for testing:**

#. Download or build a Murano image for testing.

#. Upload the image to the `admin` tenant
   in the OpenStack Image Service (Glance).

#. Open the :guilabel:`Murano` tab.

#. Navigate to the :guilabel:`Manage` submenu.

#. Click :guilabel:`Images`.

#. Click :guilabel:`Mark Image`.

   The Image registration window displays.

#. Select the Linux image with the Murano Agent.

#. In the :guilabel:`Title` field, set the title for this image.

#. Select the :guilabel:`Generic Linux` type.

#. Click :guilabel:`Mark`.

   Proceed with testing the OpenStack Application Catalog.
