Introduction to the User Guide
==============================

The Fuel User Guide provides instructions on how to configure, test, and
operate OpenStack environments using Fuel web UI and CLI.

If you have already deployed OpenStack environments using earlier versions
of the Fuel software, see the *Upgrading Fuel* section in the Fuel Installation
Guide for instructions on upgrading your existing OpenStack distribution and
the Fuel software.

Before you read this document, you must install the Fuel Master node as
described in the *Fuel Installation Guide*.
