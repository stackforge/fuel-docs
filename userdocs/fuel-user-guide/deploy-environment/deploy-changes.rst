Deploy changes
--------------

When you have completed configuring your OpenStack environment as
described in :ref:`create-env-ug` and :ref:`configure-env-ug`, you
can start the deployment.

.. warning::
   After you deploy an OpenStack environment, you will not be able to
   modify many of the OpenStack parameters, such as network topology,
   disk partitioning, and so on. Verify that you have applied correct
   settings.

**To deploy an OpenStack environment:**

#. In the Fuel web UI, select the :guilabel:`Dashboard` tab.
#. Click :guilabel:`Deploy changes`.

   Fuel deploys your OpenStack environment. Depending on the configuration
   of the environment, the deployment may take from fifteen minutes
   to an hour.
