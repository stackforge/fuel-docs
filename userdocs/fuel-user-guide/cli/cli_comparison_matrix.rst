Fuel CLI commands comparison matrix
===================================

The Fuel command-line interface has been changed to simplify usage
and improve user experience. Some of the keys and options have been modified
as well. Although the old ``fuel`` commands are still available, we recommend that
you use the new ``fuel2`` commands instead. The following table describes
new ``fuel2`` commands and their alternatives in the ``fuel`` CLI.
