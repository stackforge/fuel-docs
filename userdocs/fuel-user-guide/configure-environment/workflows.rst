Modify the deployment workflow
==============================

A deployment workflow, or deployment graph, is an hierarchy of
deployment tasks with dependencies that Fuel executes to deploy
an OpenStack environment.
A deployment graph enables you to execute complex orchestrated workflows,
such as bugfixes application, reference architecture altering, or upgrades
in a particular order. For example, you can enable specific
network verification tasks for a Fuel plugin or change the default image
delivering protocol (HTTP) for OpenStack nodes provisioning, and so on.

.. warning::
   This section describes advanced usage and requires the user to deeply
   understand Fuel internals. Do not modify deployment workflows if you are
   deploying an OpenStack environment for the first time.
