Manage workfows
===============

Fuel enables you to manage the deployment workflows through both the Fuel web
UI and CLI. You can view, upload, download, and execute default workflows
as well as the custom ones. Execution of the custom deployment workflows
and merging them with the default deployment workflows allows for the
implementation of complex orchestrated workflows, such as bug fixes application,
reference architecture alteration, and upgrades.
