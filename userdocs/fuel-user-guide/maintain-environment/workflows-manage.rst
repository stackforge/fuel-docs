Manage workflows
================

Fuel enables you to manage the deployment workflows through both the Fuel web
UI and CLI. You can view, upload, download, execute, and delete default
workflows as well as the custom ones. Execution of the custom deployment
workflows and merging them with the default deployment workflows allows for
the implementation of complex orchestrated workflows, such as bug fixes
application, reference architecture alteration, and upgrades.
