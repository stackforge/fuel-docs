   upgrade/upgrade-liberty

.. note:: Fuel does not support upgrades for plugins. The old plugin
          versions may not be compatible with the new version of Fuel.
          Therefore, you must uninstall the Fuel plugins before
          upgrading Fuel. See :ref:`plugins_upgrade_uninstall_plugin`.
