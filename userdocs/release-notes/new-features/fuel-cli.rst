===============================
Fuel CLI versions consolidation
===============================

Consolidated two versions of the Fuel CLI ``fuel`` and ``fuel2``. The ``fuel2``
entry point now provides a complete set of features as well as contains
advanced capabilities and a better structured syntax of commands. The old
Fuel CLI will be deprecated in one of the future releases.
