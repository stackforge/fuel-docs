* Changed the Fuel serialization process to fix the Nailgun behavior
  in complex OVS+VLAN network environments with multiple node groups
  and network templates. Previously, it was impossible to use network
  templates and multiple node groups with OVS+VLAN Neutron providers
  due to unnumbered ``br-prv`` networks. See
  `LP1556917 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/fuel/+bug/1556917>`_.
