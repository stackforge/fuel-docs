Plugin node roles
-----------------

Defining a new role allows you to explicitly define all the tasks that run on
it.

Defining a new role is convenient if you need to run some services on
separate nodes:

* If you deploy a service with some specific hardware or security
  requirements.

* If your software conflicts with some of the packages installed on
  the existing roles

* If the tasks that you execute conflict with the existing tasks.
