Fields:


   * ``name`` -- Name of the plugin that will be in the plugin's RPM file name.
     The allowed name characters are lowercase letters, dash ``-``, and
     underscore ``_``.
   * ``title`` -- Human-readable plugin name displayed on the Fuel web UI.
   * ``version`` -- Plugin version. For guidelines, see
     `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <http://semver.org/>`_.
   * ``fuel_version`` -- The Fuel version that your plugin is compatible with.
     Currently, the builder verifies ``fuel_version`` only against
     ``package_version``. The ``package_version`` field must be supported
     by the Fuel versions listed at the bottom of this section.
     Leaving this field empty will skip the check. For format guidelines,
     see `_ClassType StrictVersion <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/stdlib/distutils.version.StrictVersion-class.html>`_.
   * ``licenses`` -- List the licenses under which your plugin can be
     distributed.
   * ``authors`` -- Name of the plugin author. A company or an individual.
   * ``homepage`` -- A link to page with your plugin. This can be your plugin's
     GitHub repository page.
   * ``is_hotpluggable`` -- State if the plugin is hot-pluggable.
     See :ref:`plugin-hotpluggable`.
   * ``groups`` -- A group to which your plugin belongs in the Fuel web UI.
   * ``releases`` --  A list of OpenStack releases compatible with the plugin.

     * ``releases: os`` -- A compatible Linux distribution for the plugin.
       The supported values are ``ubuntu`` and ``centos``. Fuel 8.0 supports
       only Ubuntu.
     * ``releases: version`` -- A compatible OpenStack release version.
       Fuel Plugin Builder does not validate the ``releases: version``
       field; but if there is no OpenStack release with the same version
       on the Fuel Master, the user cannot enable the plugin. See also a
       note in :ref:`install-plugin-builder`.
     * ``releases: mode`` -- A list of compatible cluster deployment modes.
       Fuel 8.0 supports only the ``haz`` value.
     * ``releases: deployment_scripts_path`` -- A path in your plugin directory
       where all the deployment scripts for the release are. The path is
       relative to the plugin root.
     * ``releases: repository_path`` -- A path in your plugin directory where
       all the packages for the release are. Relative to the plugin root.

   * ``package_version`` -- A version of the compatible plugin format.
     To build your plugin, the Fuel Plugin Builder version must be the same
     as the version of the compatible plugin format or newer. Each new plugin
     format version introduces new features and, possibly, deprecates some of
     the old ones. The Fuel master node must support the specific
     ``package_version``, otherwise, you cannot install the plugin.

     The table below shows the existing plugin format versions and the versions of
     Fuel starting from which they are supported:

     +---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
     | Plugin format | 1.0.0 | 2.0.0 | 3.0.0 | 4.0.0 | 5.0.0 |
     +---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
     | Fuel          | 6.0   | 6.1   | 7.0   | 8.0   | 9.0   |
     +---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
