Introduction to the Fuel Plugin SDK Guide
=========================================

The Fuel Plugin SDK Guide provides instructions on how to build, test, and
troubleshoot your plugins; the guide also gives an overview of the existing
plugins.

Before you read this document, you must do the following:

#. Install the latest Fuel version. See :ref:`fuel-install-guide`.
#. Deploy an OpenStack environment with one controller and one compute node.
   See :ref:`create-env-ug`. Please note that for testing purposes you will need to use at
   least 3 Controller nodes for high availability.

This guide is a work in progress and will eventually have most of
the information you need on Fuel Plugin SDK. In the meantime, use
the `community Wiki page <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins>`_
as a supplementing reference.
