.. _repository-branching:

Managing Git branches
---------------------

To track the release cycle efficiently, branch your project or use tags.

Difference between a branch and a tag:

* A tag represents a version of a particular branch at a moment in time.
* A branch represents a separate thread of development that may run
  concurrently with other development efforts on the same code base.
  Changes to a branch may eventually be merged back into another branch
  to unify them.

Examples:

* For a tagging example, see the `VPNaaS plugin <https://github.com/openstack/fuel-plugin-neutron-vpnaas>`_ repository.
* For a branching example, see the `LMA plugin <https://github.com/openstack/fuel-plugin-lma-collector>`_ repository.
