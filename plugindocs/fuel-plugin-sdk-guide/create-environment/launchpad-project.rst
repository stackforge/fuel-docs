Launchpad project
-----------------

Create a Launchpad project as the single entry point for reporting
issues on your plugin and tracking development progress.

Plugin Launchpad project recommendations:

* The project name must be in the format ``fuel-plugin-<your plugin's name>``.
* The project creation procedure is standard.
  See `the official Launchpad documentation <https://help.launchpad.net/Projects>`_.
* The project page must link to the source plugin repository and its
  entry in `DriverLog <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/DriverLog>`_.
* The project teams must incorporate all development team members.
* The milestones must repeat the plugin release specified in the
  ``metadata.yaml file``; for example, ``1.0.0``, ``2.0.0``.
