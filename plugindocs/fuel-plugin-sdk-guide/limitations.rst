Limitations
===========

* Core functionality of Fuel plugins can only be installed before configuring
  and deploying the environment. Otherwise, you will have to redeploy the

  installed later on top of the already deployed environments.
* Fuel plugins cannot be upgraded from one major to another major version.
* Fuel plugins for SDN solutions cannot create a new networking option in
  the Fuel web UI wizard.
